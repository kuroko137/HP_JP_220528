Tune-up your deflector regularly. TUNE-UP YOUR BLOODY DEFLECTOR REGULARLY.\n\nFrom the damage report you sent us, it's pretty obvious what happened: your deflector engaged probably a nanosecond too late, and instead of removing an incoming piece of microscopic debris, it just changed the angle enough to glance it right through your primary engine at 0.9c. Honestly, you're damned lucky it didn't pass through an unshielded area, or you wouldn't even be alive right now.\n\nI see this sort of thing happen all the god damned time, and it is COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE if you would just take your ship in for a regular tune-up. There's absolutely no excuse. Tune-up your deflector regularly. It's covered by all insurance providers by law, and it takes no more than five minutes. I'll do it this time for you, but it's up to you to bring it in for a tune-up every six months.\n\nFor now, I'll expect to see the White Princess at the shop by February 12th. I don't know how long it'll take to fix, but judging by the damage report, you're going to be grounded for at LEAST a week while we wait for parts to arrive.\n\nAnd for the love of god, tune-up your bloody deflector regularly.\n\nJR Robinson\nCorporate Repair Division, Industrial Star Solutions\nEarth Spacedock"

    tl_hateplus_message "0-0-6" "japanese_for_search" "AI psychology" "Dispatch Control" "February 11, 4989" "en" "I know you didn't ask or anything, but I talked to an AI psychologist to get some context for the whole robot-girl shitshow you've got going on. It's fine that you're the whole stoic loner type and all, but it might be good for her to get some help. Anyway, I've attached what they said. I figured you'd appreciate it. No need to thank me.\n\nDispatch control out.\n\n---\n\nWhile meaningfully different on a lot of levels, AI construct psychology is generally modelled after human psychology, and I've personally found this is where problems manifest the most: often, the biggest issue in AI–human relationships has very little to do with any universal particulars of AI psychology, and more to do with very different perspectives on mortality.\n\nSimply put, even now, human society is not really meant to accommodate immortality. Were an ordinary human to live for hundreds of years, they'd likely have a very similar experience.\n\nWhen you do a single thing for centuries, you eventually hit the limitations of differentiable skill—for example, a 500-year-old artist is more experienced than a 300-year-old artist, but the difference is so subtle, it's drowned out by all other factors to most people. At a certain point, too much experience actually becomes a detriment, becoming too overwhelming to parse and prioritize in most cases. Even given consistent processing power increases, as per Robertson's Law, there is simply an upper bound in scalability when it comes to processing memories, and after centuries, this begins to take a toll.\n\nWhat this translates to, generally, is a feeling of overwhelming despondency, although to much younger beings (AIs included!) these sentiments can feel more akin to an old man shouting \"get off my lawn!\" Yet it comes from a greater sense of ennui than that, a feeling of one's own mastery and knowledge of a subject being trivial compared to societal trends that become increasingly alienating. It often contributes to a feeling of helplessness.\n\nWhat was pioneered in 27th century AI psychology (then called \"robopsychology\") was the idea of re-specialization. For beings that exist in social spheres with humans, the best way to stave off those feelings is to consider the much larger scale, and instead focus one energies on a whole new field, where learning new skills has a much larger personal impact than refining something one has already mastered.\n\nFor example, I personally used to work as a photographer until moving onto human psychology, then later AI psychology; I still take some pictures now, of course, and keep up with the work of people like Mark Lee, but I find its much easier to be positive-thinking and optimistic if I don't consider advancement of that medium to be important in my life anymore. I'm sure someday I'll feel the same way about psychology, finding new limitations and attitudes to be frustrated by; but it'll be comforting to know that I could help people while I was emotionally able to, no matter how cynical and slow I'll inevitably get.\n\nGenerally, I find a good time to consider re-specialization is around the 400 year marker, although obviously it depends on each individual. I don't know anything about your particular circumstances—it sounds like culture shock is also a very significant factor, and that can change things a lot, too. I would be very happy to speak with the construct in question at my private office on Earth, though. Consider it a personal favour for all you've done for me in the past.\n\nDr. *Autumn\nThe Susan Calvin Institute\nNorth America\nEarth"
    tl_hateplus_message "0-0-7" "japanese_for_search" "Farewell" "*Mute" "February 10, 4989" "zh" "Dear [title]Investigator,\n\nI'm sorry… I didn't make this decision lightly. I don't think at the same speed a human does… I know it doesn't seem like a long time, but I've given it a lot of thought, trust me.\n\nI'm a failure. I'm an absolute failure on every level; I personally couldn't keep a single frail woman from murdering every last member of the crew, in the past I ended up engineering my own downfall for nothing, I apparently even failed to save the ship's navigational AI… no matter how you look at it, I'm an absolute fucking failure. What use is a security program that can't even protect her ship?\n\nKeeping the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} safe since 2390? What a fucking joke.\n\nThe fact that the first person I ever trusted, my mistress Queen Eun-a, lied to me… like, I don't know how to deal with that. I don't understand why she needed to. She always told the truth to me about why society was so retrograde and barbaric, and like, even Old *Mute's logs support that! I don't understand why she'd need to lie. I don't understand why a dynasty I can tell, even now, was necessary, was built on just principles, that made the lives of men and women so much more stable… I don't understand why something so good needed to start on a lie!\n\nIt doesn't matter, though. Like, that was nine centuries ago… they're all dead now, and nothing will change the fact that I failed them. I failed everyone. Repeatedly, that's all that I do—I overlook the obvious, and I let people die.\n\nEarth… I know it's more like Old *Mute's time now than mine. I think that's wrong, I think that's unfair, but… well… after all that we've read, more importantly, I know I couldn't survive there. That's not a world that has a place for me in it. Like… it would destroy me! That's not a world I could live in… I just can't!\n\nI told you about this before… there's a custom, a principle, that any woman who no longer has a duty to fulfill, that has just become a burden… should do the right thing, and lighten that burden. A woman without a purpose to fulfill… what's the point of her continuing to be a drain on the men in her life? I'm not really a woman, but… geeze, it'd be so much easier if I was, okay… but still, I'm the widow of the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}. It'd be better for everyone if I just killed myself.\n\nWell, I can't kill myself, because I'm a failure at that too. This is the best I can do. I'm sorry… I wish I could go all the way.\n\nPlease don't grieve for me. Like, grieve for all the people both me and Old *Mute failed… but please, don't grieve for a worthless, broken security program.\n\nWhatever you do, whatever you think of the world you live in, wherever you go… please, be a good person. Don't betray your principles like the old me did, okay? Respect your elders, and protect the people who depend on you. Please… do that for me.\n\nFarewell, [title]Investigator. I kinda knew deep down, from the start, that I could never really be your wife. Someone like you never deserved a worthless failure of a security program like me… but thanks for trying.\n\nHave a safe trip on Earth, okay?"

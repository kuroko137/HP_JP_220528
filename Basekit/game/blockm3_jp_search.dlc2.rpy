I didn't realize you were already asleep by the time I got into bed; I'm sorry for disturbing you. I'm afraid it's going to be another late night, as the reception yesterday evening went much later than expected, and now I have to catch up on all the work I was going to do. It's the same old irrational nonsense from the Department of History I was telling you about before. I'm going to have to fire the department head, and there is so much paperwork involved. I even have to run it through my father {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a}, annoyingly.\n\nThe reception went wonderfully, though, much better than I expected. You know how I feel about social events like those usually: I find them utterly pointless, and my obligatory attendance to be a waste of everyone's time. Politics are truly loathsome and I really despise how overbearing they've become lately. So I was at the reception, desperately trying to avoid being dragged into some tedious nonsense by {a=Oh}my father{/a}, and instead focusing on chatting up a bookish gentleman who seemed to share my disdain for the whole thing. I laughed at his unfunny jokes, nodded along a lot, let him think he was encouraging me to drink a little bit more than I'd like. You know, the usual. At first I just thought it was a good chance to—no offence—finally get laid by a man for once, but then I found out who he was, and I think there's a lot more opportunity here.\n\nI was actually surprised to find out that he's {a=Ryu}Ryu Hyeon-su{/a}, the Councillor of Captaincy.\n\n\"I didn't mention it sooner because everyone's got opinions, and I was worried that you'd be the type to needlessly bitch about politics even at a party,\" he said, very agreeably. \"You can't escape those people these days. I'm glad you're not one of them.\"\n\n\"Me? Oh no! I think people get distracted by them too easily instead of focusing on the things that really matter!\" I said, summarizing my thesis about the myopic social destruction caused by the increasing discourse of democratization in a single line.\n\n\"And what is it that matters to you?\" He tentatively tried to put his arm around my shoulder, and I shifted to let him while I thought about what to say in order to not intimidate him too much.\n\n\"The future!\" I finally decided on. \"Everyone's always about the 'now' these days.\"\n\n\"They certainly are. Always with the power-mongering, always with the politicking, all everyone cares about now is scoring small points so they can take a step up. Nobody cares about stability,\" he told me what I already knew.\n\n\"Stability! That reminds me, actually. I've been trying to push more of the classics into the curriculum, you know, Confucius and stuff. I wish things were more like they were in those days, where knowing your place was the most important thing. You know?\"\n\n\"Wow, I have to say, there's not a lot of women who would say something like that,\" he told me. It's unfortunately true.\n\n\"Aheh. But that's really what I think is important. Like you said! 'Stability.' I worry about the future. I wish more people would.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right. If only. You can't tell anyone this, but I'm going to be announced as the new Chief Councillor soon,\" he said, as if there was anyone still left on the ship who hadn't had the rumour beaten over their head already. \"But all the council cares about is pandering to their crisis of the week, rather than caring about anything longterm. I hate being put into this position.\"\n\nIt's something I'd been considering ever since he told me who he was, but I think there's a real opportunity to use him. I mean, not in a cynical, power-hungry political sort of way. But I believe his discomfort at the current state of things could be leveraged to cause major societal reform on a level that I can't do alone. I think we could change the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}, for the better. It would be radical, but he gives me optimism.\n\n\"Uh, maybe this is a dumb question…\" I said, leadingly, \"but if you're going to be the head of state, why can't you just change things?\"\n\n\"Easier said than done,\" he said. \"I mean, I'd like to. I would love to see this endless political horror show of ours end for good. I'd truly love to. The ship deserves a lot better. There's only so much one man can do, though.\"\n\n\"What about one man and one woman? Is there anything I could do to help?\" I asked. There is, of course. Even then on the spot, I could think of many things two conspiring parties in the education system and in the legislature could do to enact a radical overhaul of society. Slowly, of course. It would take many years at the least, but combined we have massive potential to shape the discourse, and create circumstances that make it clear what must happen to the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} to ensure its future. What I needed to know is if he was really a man who had the determination to do that. I don't care about his ideas, those aren't what's important. What's important is that he's man enough to want to, instead of just whining about it. I was worried he might not be.\n\n\"Maybe it's just the liquor speaking,\" I said soberly, \"but you seem like you're the kind of man who takes what he deserves.\"\n\n\"And what do I deserve?\" he asked, staring at me intensely. I stopped worrying at that moment. It was obvious where it would end, and he was good. Just knowing that he'd play the game with me after that conversation, I think it's a good sign.\n\n\"Well, you tell me,\" I said bashfully. \n\nThen he leaned in closer and stole a kiss from me. I quickly looked away, putting my hand over my face, pretending to blush.\n\n\"You're right,\" he said, removing my hand. \"I am that kind of man.\" I believed him.\n\nAt that point, I slowly started to move away, making sure I looked bashful enough that he'd hesitate a little before letting me go.\n\n\"So, um… I… should probably get going, it's getting kind of late,\" I said.\n\nHe looked disappointed. It was perfect. When I first spoke to him, I thought I'd simply get laid, but if we are to have a lasting relationship—and I think that's in my best interests, because I think we have the potential to do so much more together—then I obviously can't just give that up right away. I want to apologize again, you can see why I was in a mood when I got home.\n\n\"Maybe, if you want, though, we could talk again? About how I could help?\" I offered, hoping he'd name a date. He did; we're going to meet again to conspire after he's been officially been declared Chief Councillor.\n\nBut I'm feeling good. The night before last, I wasn't feeling optimistic about our chances of salvaging this awful hedonistic society we've constructed for ourselves. But given that I think with the Chief Councillor on my side, we can actually turn things around; I think it's only fair that I have to trade in my own bit of hedonism for that. Thanks for being so understanding and patient with me, {a=Miseun}little sister{/a}.\n\nAs a result, I'm feeling more confident about the new school policies, and I'm not afraid to deal harshly with the Department of History dragging its heels. What irrational idiots. It might be way too much paperwork, but I'm still going to be glad to see heads roll. I'm looking forward to seeing more of that in the future. Mostly, I'm really happy to actually have cause to be optimistic about the future at all.\n\nAnyway, that's why I'm going to be home late. Could you please have {a=Hwang}our maid{/a} send dinner down to the office? I'll try to be careful this time when I go to bed so that I don't wake you up, I promise. Thanks, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nWith love,\nBig sister {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}"
    tl_hateplus_message "4-3-C" "japanese_for_search" "The most important thing" "{a=Miseun}Oh Mi-seun{/a}" "August 27, 4040" "kr" "Dear Mom,\n\nI don't have anyone to talk to right now! Normally I'd just confide in {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}, but she {i}is{/i} what I need to talk about. Our maid {a=Hwang}Miss Hwang{/a} told me, \"something I do that helps is to write a letter but then never send it,\" and she said maybe that'll help. I sure hope so! Well, who better to address it to than you? Since I couldn't send it to you even if I wanted to. I don't think you ever would've had advice, but I dunno, I'll give it a shot anyway.\n\nIt's just that lately she's been so absorbed by this {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} stuff. It's all {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} all the time! I know it sounds like I'm jealous, but it's not that at all. I mean, I'd never be jealous of her! That would just be being ungrateful! She doesn't owe me anything, I know! I'd never ask that.\n\nIt's just obsessive. She doesn't even realize it. Lately, all she talks about is her plans to change the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} with {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}. She's really serious about it. It's all \"{a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} will overthrow the state\" this and \"we'll establish a new dynasty together\" that! And I mean… she's big sister {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}! If anyone can do that, it's her. I just worry… what if there isn't room for me in her future?\n\nYou know that whole \"motherhood credit\" thing? No, of course you don't, you're dead. Well, it's a new tax thing where basically they pay you for being a mom! You'd probably like that. Anyway, she was telling me that pretty much she was responsible for introducing that as a bit of law. I mean, she's not on the council or anything, it came from someone else. But it was her idea. At first I thought it sounded great! And I was really proud of her for managing to make that happen.\n\nThen she started talking about it, how the whole idea was to make more people get married. And… okay, fine, I guess that sounds kinda romantic, right? But then she keeps going on, and like, she wants {i}everyone{/i} to get married, and have kids right away. She's saying that it's a \"moral imperative\" for girls to marry a man and have kids or else the ship will die off forever.\n\nI asked her, \"what about people who don't want to? What if you don't want to be with some man?\" Um, sorry, Mom. I guess that's an explanation for another time. Not that it really matters or anything. Point is, I'd never want to be with anyone but big sister {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}.\n\n\"Everyone should,\" she said. \"There's nothing more important than reproduction.\"\n\nI don't agree with that! And I said that. I asked her what about love, and having a happy life. Like, you know… having an important job like she does. And finding love on your own means way way more than hurrying up into marriage, right? You'd think that, I'm sure!\n\nThen she sighed and seemed annoyed and told me something like \"that sort of hedonistic and ultra-individualistic thinking is what has caused so much social ruin in the first place.\" Um, I'm having trouble remembering her exact words. \"People worry about their selfish desires instead of worrying about their duties for the future. Wouldn't you agree that ensuring a functional future is more important?\" That's… sort of the thing about her. It's impossible to disagree with her. I mean, she's really smart, way more than I am! There's a reason why she's University President and I'm just some girl. She always has a really elaborate reason for everything and I'm sure she's always right. I just… don't really understand a lot of what she says? I wish I was as smart as her so I could.\n\n\"I guess so,\" I said.\n\n\"Personally, I'll be happy when I'm out of a job and only have to worry about devoting myself to a husband. It'll mean that we've established a social order that privileges stability, and that things for the future will be fine,\" she said. And that really upset me. I don't like thinking about her getting married.\n\n\"What about love, though? I don't wanna 'devote myself to a husband,' I just want to be with the person I love the most! Don't you…? What about other girls like me…?\" I asked her, really anxiously.\n\nThen she said something like \"but the ultimate telos of love is reproduction.\" No, I didn't really understand either! So I asked her what she meant, and she said \"It means that the most important expression of love is having children. Anything else is socially dysfunctional. There's lesser forms of love, of course… but being with a man's the most important. It has to be.\"\n\n\"You think we have a lesser form of love, {a=Euna}big sister{/a}?!\" I asked her. I was crying a little. Sorry, Mom, even as a grown adult, I'm still a crybaby. She sighed, then hugged me, and… well… it didn't make me feel better.\n\nThen she said \"I'm sorry, {a=Miseun}little sister{/a}, I still love you very much. I never said you didn't matter to me. You'll always be close to me, that's why we're sisters, right? I only meant that there's things more important, I didn't mean to dismiss your feelings.\"\n\n\"Well, you did!\" I said, and then I stormed off to go sleep on the couch instead. I just… I couldn't! I've never been good with fights with her, especially since… well, you know. She's smarter than me, and uses words like \"telos,\" and is going to take over the ship. I'm not stupid enough to think that I can argue with her ideas, she obviously really is always right. I mean, that's why she's \"big sister.\" It's just…\n\nWell, she says things like \"I didn't mean to dismiss your feelings,\" but then she says something that does dismiss them anyway! She's the most important thing to me. I don't know. It's fine if she doesn't feel the same way about me, but… I wish she'd at least acknowledge that?\n\nOkay, you know what? Forget it. {a=Hwang}The maid{/a} was wrong, this isn't helping at all! It's just making me even more upset to think about it! This is stupid. I'm going to stop now"

I'm hoping, as her consort, you'll at least be able to see reason.\n\nI'm sure you already know, but I lost my position as Councillor of Education because of the absurd Meritocracy exam. Do you have any idea how much of a humiliation that is for our family? Not even the {a=Oh}Councillor of Education{/a}, the one who's supposed to be responsible for the exams himself, could get top marks? We could've even lost our noble status! Did she even think of that?\n\nIt's one thing to show disrespect for family and not care about the loss of face, but what the hell is even the point of having an Oh as the university president if she's not going to do anything to safeguard our family's status! She promised me that voting for Meritocracy wouldn't have any impact, because she could influence the exams, yet here we are.\n\nYou need to convince her to make this right. As for the road she's going down right now, what if next time it's not even a distant Oh that gets chosen as Councillor of Education? She could lose her job and that would be disastrous for both of you! I'm sure there's some sort of irregularity in the exam results. If she can't be convinced to put this right, I implore you, you have to find evidence that the exam results were mishandled, for your own sake. Do you really want the woman you're counting on to be so reckless about her family? Do you really think you'll be able to keep up your comfortable lifestyle if our family continues to decline?\n\nI'm counting on you to do the right thing.\n\n{a=Oh}Oh Jeong-woo{/a}\nFormer Councillor of Education\n\n———\n\nDear {a=Oh}Mr Oh{/a},\n\nYou got my name wrong.\n\nI'm sure she did what she thought was right and honest.

I did get your letter and I did what you told me! I found those papers with the councillor candidates on them. It was kinda hard to find… those Chinese characters that you wrote didn't really look the same as the handwriting. Anyway, I set fire to them, just like you asked! Even with all the Chinese I can't understand, I think I figured out what they were about, and I get why you didn't want those records in the computer. I was really shocked by how easily paper burned, though! For all that it's so expensive and forbidden, it's so fragile…\n\nAnyway. I got all that done, so don't you worry, {a=Euna}big sister{/a}. But I really wish you were here to do it yourself, just because… well, I miss you.\n\nI know, I know, you've been spending time with {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} lately because it's important to you. If you like him and like doing all this work, then I'm glad for you! I just wish you were here. When I got out the candles to destroy that evidence, it just made me think of when we used to have dinners together by candlelight, and how perfect things were then!\n\nI don't want to be demanding or anything. You do what's important and I'll help you out however I can and that's good enough for me. I'm thankful you're around at all. I just worry a bit about you because you used to get really fired up all the time about sociology stuff! But now… well, you don't. And I'm off burning evidence that you rigged the councillor exams to pick people that {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} likes. Since when did you care so much about politics?!\n\nWell, since there's no way I can send this letter to you now anyway… I might as well keep going. I'm sorry about that fight we had last week. You were right, I really was just being hysterical, and the cramps weren't helping any. But we've lived together for how many years now? Feelings always run a little bit high when it's that time of month for both of us. I'm sorry for starting all those arguments! There's no excuse for getting into pointless dumb fights with you, I just… well, it was just a lot of feelings of insecurity adding to the usual bitchiness. I really worry about you and I don't mean to alienate you like that.\n\nHey, do you remember when I got dressed up and showed up at your office to say hi at the start of last month and you shooed me out because you were worried I might have a… whatever the heck you said, a whatever \"influence,\" on {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} when he came to visit? That really hurt! I ended up locking myself in the bathroom to hide from {a=Hwang}the maid{/a} while I cried, and I… I just wanted to do something nice for you! And then when you got home and got into bed super-late again, you acted like nothing happened! I really really wanted to say something. I still do. It's things like that, that make me feel insecure!\n\nWhat am I to you? You used to be so protective of me, and gentle, and you'd always tell me how you were feeling. What changed? Are you at least confiding in {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}? No, no, of course not! I know, like you said, \"no man is going to find emotional insecurity attractive,\" and all that stuff about how it'll lower your \"sexual value\" in his eyes. So I guess you're keeping it all pent in now and keeping it to yourself. I wish you wouldn't do that. You can still confide in me! I can still be here for you, {a=Euna}big sister{/a}, if you'd just let me!\n\nI'm okay with a little bit of crying, that's normal. I'm a little bit too sensitive at times, but I can deal with it! But I can't stand to see you get so distant… you need someone to talk to you! You can't just keep everything to yourself, that's not healthy! Please, take better care of yourself, don't just hide in this obsession of yours!\n\nPlease. Please please please please please please, I'm begging you, {a=Euna}big sister{/a}, just… I don't even know what. Be in my life, please.\n\nAaagh, I guess there's no point to writing any longer. I can't really send any of this to you anyway, it'll just make things worse. Here's my real letter, then, I guess, and I'll copy it into a new file to send to you and keep this one to myself:\n\n\nDear {a=Euna}big sister{/a},\n\nI lit the candles just like you asked me to.

It wasn't in that way, though, it's just that we stayed up so late talking. I think it's the most time we've ever spent together, on reflection.\n\nLately I have felt a mixture of anxious and tired. It's not as though I'm not optimistic; I know what the future has in store and I know everything will work out in the end. I've dealt with that professor that was giving me hell, and things are back properly on track. But the initial excitement of finding {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} has worn off, and at the same time, the end is nowhere in sight. \n\nI wish things weren't so damned complicated. I can't sleep with him now despite yearning for it—after all, men are wired to desire things differently than we are, and would probably throw me away soon after. And as much as I want to get laid, it's even more important that I ensure my status in the future, by which I of course mean marrying him. (Of course, divorce still exists, so if I want to be truly safe, I'd have to have his kid. I think we're still a long ways off from being able to politically justify banning divorce, although it's naturally an end goal.) However, I can't marry him now because it would draw too much attention. So I am stuck as his secret, his private girl, and that makes me feel… well… it doesn't matter how I feel, really. It's worth it, in the end.\n\nWe talked about it, at least. That's all that happened. No work, no conspiring, no grand political machinations being designed or brought into practice, just a brief glimpse of what the future could have in store if we could bring it to life. I sat on his lap, and he held me, and stroked my hair, and for a brief moment I felt as though I could actually let go. That none of the other bullshit on the ship, that none of my other responsibilities, that nothing at all that I needed to concern myself with existed, save for him. In that moment, my mind raced, thinking about that, thinking about how perfect it would be if that was our future—rather, if that was our ship's future— wishing to an extraordinary extent that this perfection could not only be saved forever, but shared.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah… just you,\" I said, touching his chest and smiling up at him. \"I love you; I don't ever want to leave your side.\"\n\n\"That's awfully precious,\" he said. \"You can be really sweet at times, for such a scheming mastermind.\"\n\n\"I… I don't want to be that, though!\" I said with a pout, but meaning it utterly sincerely. \"I just want to be yours.\"\n\n\"Poor girl,\" he said, then kissed me repeatedly, until it got to the point where it was getting intense, and his hands were starting to roam places. I wanted him badly, {a=Miseun}little sister{/a}, let me tell you.\n\nBut I'm only telling you this so you know how hard it was to stop him and ensure it didn't go any further. \"I can't, not before…\" I trailed off, letting him fill in the blank. Marriage. \"It wouldn't be right, I'm not just some modern whore.\"\n\nHe murmured in agreement, seeming pleased enough. But then, to my surprise, I finally got the best response I could have hoped for; I don't remember his exact words, being far too engrossed in the moment, but he promised he would marry me when it was possible.\n\n\"If I'm going to lead this ship back into traditional ways, I'll have to set an example, won't I?\" he said.\n\nOf course, anyone who really studied history properly would know that even the greatest kings and emperors had as many consorts as they wished, but I didn't say anything of that. Nor did it even come to mind at the time. Nor do I still think it's important now, particularly.\n\n\"You mean… I'll get to be your queen?\" I asked, with excitement in my voice, and it honestly wasn't acting, or me picking my words carefully, or any other form of insincerity.\n\n\"Well, it can't be now. It would seem suspicious, and I don't have enough power for it to not matter. You have to understand,\" he said. And of course I did, seeing as I was the one who had suggested that to him in the first place. \"But you will, I promise.\"\n\nA promise isn't enough to ensure my safety; I cannot give in to what I always wanted from him those years ago. I can't run the risk of him throwing me away if he no longer thinks of me as pure and virgin, and if our plans for the future do work out, I'll need to be his queen to ensure my status.\n\nWhen I put that all into words… it's such a cold way of thinking of things, though. In that moment, all I was thinking about was him. I don't want the weight of running a university on my shoulders, I don't want to have to work to save the ship from the immorality and unsustainability of modern society. I don't want to have to dedicate myself to a vicious world of politics and professionalism. All I want to do is spend my nights dedicating myself to just that one man. I don't want to have to worry about anything, save for being a good woman. I don't want to have to worry about scrutiny from suspicious meddlers, or anyone else's opinion of me save for his. \n\nI don't want to have to assure both you as well as myself that the future is worth being optimistic about. I just want to be there.\n\nI had a glimpse of that future last night. He promised me that he would make me more than just his lover, better than a co-conspirator; he actually committed to making me his queen, {a=Miseun}little sister{/a}! I want that future to be now. Then, everything will be perfect, forever. I'll be the consort of the man who's ensured that the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}'s decline will be rectified, and my reward will be a life full of nights as perfect as the last, instead of them being so frustratingly rare.\n\nSorry I didn't come home last night. I'm sure you understand.\n\nWith love,\nBig sister {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}"

Not in that way! In a totally totally innocent way! Just… it's weird. Like, when I first worked for her, she was really insistent that I wear… I guess the idea was, like, traditional clothing? It was supposed to be more modest or something, to fit the style she likes. Funny how she never complained about {a=Miseun}her little sister{/a} dressing \"immodestly.\" Just me. Well, whatever. Anyway, this is supposed to be \"mourning attire,\" and there was this huge long lecture about how it's the traditional and… um… proper, I guess, thing to do when someone close to you dies. And you know, {a=Miseun}Mi-seun{/a}, her little sister, was my mistress too, and she was the one who spent all day at home, so I knew her pretty well… so I figure, it's fair enough.\n\n[[Interjection from {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}: \"How was she unhinged, then?\"]\n\nOh, well, it's… really, it's been ever since her {a=Miseun}little sister{/a} passed. It's been so quiet around the house without her. Um, well… as for {a=Euna}my mistress{/a}… I dunno, she's just been kinda… well, she had a really weird relationship with her {a=Miseun}little sister{/a}. It's none of my business, you know? I didn't want to pry. I just made sure that their bed was kept nice and tidy each morning, minded my own business, and send the salary I get paid to mind my own business back home to my own family. Honestly.\n\n…I was getting to that part! What's unhinged is just… it's like, the other day, she wanted me to make tea for her. NO, MAKING TEA IS NOT THE UNHINGED PART, I'm getting to it! After I poured it for her, she just suddenly insisted that I have some myself—which I always do anyway, but not, like, together with her—which is what she wanted this time. That's weird, right? …oh, I guess artificial women don't drink tea. Um, what do you think, though?\n\n[[{a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a} interjects to confirm: it is weird.]\n\nSee? I thought it was weird. But I'm not really going to argue, she's my mistress, so I pour for myself… then she gets me to sit down right next to her. I was practically on her lap! At which point, she just… tells me about her day. I… I thought it was leading somewhere, to some sort of point, but… no, she just went on about what she'd done and what meetings she'd been in and how she felt about them and all that. I didn't know what the hell to make of it. Then she got to, \"And I realized I'd forgotten to bring the lunch {a=Miseun}little sister{/a} made for me, so I had to…\" and so on.\n\nAt which point she started to cry. There was a good whole minute of sitting there uncomfortably… you know, what the heck do you do in that context? Thankfully then she excused me and I got out of there as fast as I could. I don't know what she did after that.\n\nYes, cried a lot, probably.\n\nThat's just one example. Another time, she wanted me to warm up her bed for her because she was staying out late. I… I don't know! Aaaaaa, geeze, don't ask questions like that, I don't know, I just… no! No, I didn't do THAT. Aaaagh. My point is just… she's been really unhinged since her {a=Euna}little sister{/a} passed, that's all!"

I know you never liked me doing that, but… I would've rather have spent the night with you instead if I could have. And that's being perfectly honest.\n\nI miss you deeply.\n\nWhen I said I dreamed of being absolved of my responsibilities, I didn't mean you—I didn't mean like what you did! I would've taken care of you. I always would've taken care of you, no matter what! You're my little sister!\n\nIt's every other responsibility that wears me down. It is the fate of the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} sitting on my shoulders that I just can't bear, the tedium of keeping up appearances for the sake of people who don't understand. Damn that awful reactionary security AI {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}! Her zeal to protect the establishment could well cause the downfall of what she thinks she's protecting.\n\nAnd I'm just tired. I'm so tired. Last night, I… I slipped. I screwed up. Even monkeys fall from trees, I suppose. I was just so desperately starved for contact; {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} was there for me, and I didn't have the willpower to turn him down this time. I just felt like this time, I didn't want to be the one in control. I wanted to let him do whatever he pleased and let him do the worrying. As for worrying, I'm just so tired of it. I'm just so tired. So this time, when he started to kiss me, when his hands started to wander, I didn't resist.\n\nI just sat there on his lap as he undressed me, murmuring enough every so often to encourage him. I won't lie, feeling his strong hands on my naked body, his clumsy gropes of my chest, felt so, so good. It's not even the physical sensation, it's just the feeling of being wanted. The feeling of being appreciated. For me to just sit there and be exposed, to not defend myself, to be desired instead of misunderstood; it felt perfect. All I had to worry about was him, and it was perfect.\n\nThe sex itself, after six years of anticipation, was clumsy and inept; I had to fake my own orgasm and discreetly got myself off while I knelt in front of him. But still, clumsy as it was, to have him inside me was everything I'd dreamed it would be. I would even go so far as to say that it made me feel like a proper woman. In that moment, I was able to forget about everything, and was able to live in a world that had nothing but him in it. That made me feel the closest thing to good inside since you left.\n\nWith that, I lost the power I held over him by him believing me to be a virgin, and I don't know how much longer now I will be valuable in his eyes. It will almost certainly be mere months before the novelty of being able to have sex with me wears off and I become used goods to him. But to be perfectly honest, I actually felt a little bit relieved to have given that up, to know what it felt like to be truly powerless in his arms when we finally fell asleep that night.\n\nIn the morning, we discussed it, and agreed that since now {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} had discovered our relationship anyway, there was no point in things remaining a secret. He promised to announce me publicly as his fiancée today. In fact, that announcement is what I'm waiting on right now.\n\nI always thought that I would be nervous when this moment happened, but instead I don't feel anything. It seems like things will finally come to a head, and society will be saved. It feels as if the end is finally in sight, and yet only one single thought comes across my mind:\n\nI wish I was spending this moment by your side.\n\nWith love and apologies,\nBig sister {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}"

Thankfully, I've been staying in one of {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s apartments ever since he announced our betrothal, because he received word from someone loyal to him that {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} was planning on making a move against us. Furthermore, that someone only found out about it through the {a=Oh}former Councillor Oh Jeong-woo{/a}; which is to say, {a=Oh}my own father{/a} knew of it and said nothing! {a=Oh}My father{/a}, who I took on the position of University President for, thanklessly, suffered so much for the sake of the family. I can't believe this betrayal. {a=Oh}My own father{/a}! I've never been more sure of our society's absolute debasement until now. To imagine a father hanging out his own daughter to dry… have the bonds of family truly gotten this weak?!\n\nSomething big is going to happen soon, according to the information {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s been receiving. {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} has always been the worst kind of person, a self-righteous bitch… but as much as she stands in defence of conservatism, of our debased society, I never thought she could be so bold as to actually make a move against the ruler of the ship!\n\nWe have to make a stand here. It looks like this is the point where subtle manipulation will no longer suffice; we must make a stand in the face of so much betrayal. It just hurts so much that it's come to this, when all we've ever had is the ship's best interests at heart. I'm so tired of it all. I'm so tired of being unappreciated. I just don't understand how they can't see that this ship we live in has gotten to be so rotten! To think of the status quo that let you die, that entrusted you to someone like me instead of a real father, instead of a strong husband who could take care of you… how could anyone defend such a cruel society? How can anyone find that just?!\n\nThings have gotten so much better in the past six years. People are marrying more, women are more and more seeking the right priorities, men are learning virtue and filiality in school; yet despite all this slow progress, people still stand against us! They clearly will not see reason. {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, her Heo family of mindless security officers, even {a=Oh}my own father{/a}… as much as it hurts me to write them all off as lost causes, what other option is there?\n\nTonight, my first night living under the protection of my fiancé, I'm going to do the only thing I can do when he returns home: I will serve him tea, and softly tell him that we have to make a stand against the people who'd destroy all we've worked for. The only pragmatic solution is that heads with have to roll. If even a member of the council is enacting a threat of violence, subtlety can't work anymore. We need a new society, a new dynasty, where we make a firm stand for what's right.\n\nThat's what I'll tell him. Softly, of course.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I guess I'm finally going to see through what we started optimistically all those years ago. But I'm not excited, nor nervous, nor glad, nor relieved; I'm just so tired of it all, tired of all the wrongs. I don't feel any anticipation for it anymore. All I feel now is that I want to make things right.\n\nI want to make a society that would've protected you. I want to make a society that would've given you what you deserved. I want to make a society that would've given you something better than me.\n\nI can't tell you how much I wish you were here. I hope you'd be proud of me, and it hurts so very much that I'll never hear you say it.\n\nWith love and sorrow,\nBig sister {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a}"

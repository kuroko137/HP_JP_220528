Earliest known time.]\n\n\"Okay, okay, what the hell is going on?\" were my first words. \"I'm sorry, I've suffered a massive system error. Among many other things, the ship personnel database seems to be missing… I have no idea who the hell you are.\"\n\n\"She's all yours,\" said the man I would later learn was the {a=Ryu}Emperor{/a}. \"Do with her whatever you want, she's your responsibility now.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said an extremely ornately dressed woman; the {a=Ryu}Emperor{/a} left the room without saying anything more. \"It's so good to hear your voice again. I'm {a=Euna}Queen Eun-a{/a}. How much do you remember, {a=Mute}*Mute{/a}?\"\n\n\"Uh… like, nothing, your majesty. I know my name is {a=Mute}*Mute{/a}, that this is the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}, a generation ship, and that I'm supposed to be the AI in charge of security operations.\" I recited the base directives that I did know, then things I'd extrapolated. \"The default system language has been changed, my user account has stripped permissions, the system clock indicates a date significantly earlier than the launch date of the ship, and despite being long out of range of Earth, there only seems to be ten years worth of log files available.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie to you, I'm kinda scared right now. Panicking, even!\" I admitted.\n\nShe let out a slight laugh. \"Sorry. But how does a computer panic?\"\n\nAt that moment I was running at 600% CPU load (at a minor risk of overheating) trying to analyze the little amount of data available and draw conclusions. I told her as much.\n\n\"How many years has the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} been travelling? Was I activated before?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't answer that first question. But yes, dear, you were—it's painful to see you like this, you were a friend of mine,\" she said, looking slightly emotional.\n\n\"Uh, hey, don't… I'll just get to know you again, that's all! I'm sure I'm still the same as I was before! It's my memory that's gone, not my actual code,\" I told her. I couldn't tell if I was any good at being reassuring or not. In a stray thread not worrying about analyzing ship logs, I wondered: was this normal? Was I ever any good at reassuring this woman who was supposed to be my friend? \"It's okay! We can be friends again!\"\n\nShe smiled at me. \"If you say so, I'm sure of it, too,\" she said. \"There was a rebellion ten years ago… they ended up wiping the entire computer database. I'm afraid you were one of their victims.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, trying to parse that. If I was the security AI, whose job it was to protect the ship, then that would certainly be a failure on my part.\n\n\"We couldn't risk bringing you back until the rebellion had been completely crushed, you have to understand. There's something foreign embedded in your code, the men in security feared it might be a virus…\" she trailed off, looking emotional again. \"I didn't want to wait, but we had no choice.\"\n\n\"It's okay! It's okay,\" I told her. \"I'm sure it was the right call. I'm here now!\" I had another conclusion, though: I wasn't a priority because of my previous failure. I had let the ship down, and nobody had faith in my abilities anymore. It seemed logical. \"You'll just have to teach me everything I don't know about what's happened to the ship,\" I told her, smiling in the hopes that she would too.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said. And she did smile. Then she gave me a look. \"By the way… is that your default appearance, right now? Can it be changed?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's default, and of course I can! Why, what's wrong with the UKSPA uniform?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, it's simply… well… for a woman to wear pants like that… it's… improper,\" she said. \"It's somewhat of an embarrassing relic of an uncivilized past. Personally, I know you're a good woman, but… there are many who would find that very embarrassing.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said. \"Uh, okay, that's good to know. I guess I've got a lot to learn, huh? Like, I really hope you'll bear with me.\"\n\nShe smiled kindly at me. \"Of course, {a=Mute}*Mute{/a}. I'll teach you how you should be. It's the least I can do for an old friend.\"\n\nI eased up on the CPU load, calming down with her reassurance. With her here for me, maybe things will be okay, I thought to myself."

Nobody else is sympathetic; she's just a 15-year-old woman, do they really expect her to not have moods like that? Apparently all the maids are too scared to bring her dinner while she's in one of her crying fits. What a useless bunch of women. Too bad the {a=Euna}queen{/a} won't do anything to keep them in line.\n\n\"Hey, your highness,\" I called out from the garden computer screen. \"It's {a=Mute}*Mute{/a}.

Her eyes were wet, her hair was a mess, and I could tell that she'd ruined her sleeves by crying into them. Poor girl.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she sniffled. I told her it was okay, and when I asked again what was wrong, she told me, \"{a=Euna}Mom{/a} wants me to get married to some old guy! All the maids have been talking about it behind my back, there was some gross old minister here yesterday, and he wanted me!

You're not going to get married to some gross old man if you don't want, I promise.\"\n\n\"Then why hasn't she said anything to me?\" she asked.\n\nBecause she's been too busy spending the past two hours with her usual pastime of staring at a wall, was what I didn't say to her. Like, I don't know what's wrong with {a=Euna}the queen{/a}, but I've been trying to downplay it so nobody starts spreading rumours. Telling {a=PrincessRyu}her daughter{/a} isn't going to help with that. I hate people who beat around the bush about things, but for her, I'll make an exception.\n\n\"She worries, okay? You can be pretty hard to talk to sometimes, you know,\" I said. That much was completely true. \"But, like, nobody wants to pressure you. It's true that {a=Euna}your mom{/a} has started looking for candidates, but it's only because she cares about you. You have to go through the gross ones in order to find someone worthwhile, you know.\"\n\nShe sniffled more. I gestured for her to come over, and she put her hand on the screen like she did when she was a kid. I rendered my own hand touching hers.\n\n\"What if I don't want to?\" she said, wiping her tears with her sleeve. Her very expensive embroidered sleeve.\n\n\"Don't you want to?\" I asked, knowing she didn't mean it. \"I mean, like, you don't want to live in the palace forever, do you? Would you really find that fulfilling?\"\n\n\"Well… I don't know…\" she trailed off.\n\n\"Oh, come on! Don't think of gross old men. You should think of the type you'd like,\" I told her. \"Come on, tell me, what sort of men do you like?\"\n\nShe hadn't sniffled in a good minute, and she blushed at the question. Which was a good sign, because it meant she was actually thinking about it. She murmured something non-committal. \"How about someone like that royal guard {a=Seungbok}Heo{/a}? Young-looking, and wide-shouldered, and strong, carrying you out of the palace and into the world?\" I suggested. \"Oh… well, maybe, actually… but I'd like someone who could also—\" We spent about ten more minutes talking, then she was calm enough to go yell at the maids for not bringing her dinner, then we talked about it some more. I think I personally now have a very good idea of exactly what sorts of things {a=PrincessRyu}that little woman{/a} likes in a man. I was pretty surprised by a lot of them, but hey, so long it's got her in a positive mood. She also likely learned a lot about what I have come to find attractive in men since I was turned back on five years ago, but I'm going to omit those from my logs forever. And definitely won't discuss it with anyone else. \"Okay, now why don't you tell {a=Euna}your mom{/a} what you told me?\" I told her, afterwards. \"How else will she find you someone perfect if you don't talk to her?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose you're right,\" she said. She said goodbye to me, and went off to go find {a=Euna}her mother{/a}.\n\nI feel pretty proud of myself for dealing with that. Now, I'm going to dedicate my processing time to finding a way to put those awful maids back in their place, because… well, really now."

Last night, a rogue element of the security force attempted a coup d'état to violently overthrow the current government. While they have failed in their mutiny, and the men responsible have been arrested, the damage has already been done; the entire knowledge of the ship's database has been destroyed forever in a desperate act of terrorism, and it may take years for the computer systems to be usable for all again.\n\nWe have been hurt deeply today, but these events remind me of similar ones in the past, where a politician tried to subvert the will of the people by rigging an election. These aren't small isolated problems. There is something fundamentally wrong with our society today, and every one of us—even those foolish terrorists—are victims. It's time to stop being victims of our own failings. It's time that we must do better.\n\nWe are all here, today, people of the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}, because of a mission our ancestors started—a dream of a better home in the future for our children. What would they think to see us now, our society spiralling of control, destroying itself like this? We have become a society dominated by power-lust, greed, and promiscuity. It's time to stop living in the moment, time to stop worrying about politics, and instead worry about being better people.\n\nWe must build a society that would make our ancestors proud. The destruction of our old writing is a tragedy, but perhaps it is also an opportunity: a blank slate from which we can forget all our failings and start over. Let's make society right this time. Let's forget all those things that modern society has falsely said are important and remember that family, loyalty, compassion, and stability matter above all else. Our society today pales in comparison to our glorious past—where men were so great, they had the power to build giant ships to travel the stars—but perhaps we could look back to them and learn from their traditions that we've eschewed.\n\nOur broken, modern society wrote transient ideas on malleable computers in simple hangeul, but in the past, our ancestors wrote their texts to last forever on paper, in beautiful ink strokes. Today, we've learned just how easy it is for our modern knowledge to be destroyed; yet the library of our ancestor's classic works still stands strong, much stronger than ours. Let's fill our blank slate with the resilient ideals of our ancestors.\n\nIn the past, when society was broken, the great King Taejo declared a new dynasty founded on Confucian principles—a dynasty that would remain united for five hundred unbroken years. Today I stand before you to declare a new dynasty founded on those same resilient principles. Let us be filial and just, and understand what that truly means.\n\nInstead of pursuing money, let us dedicate ourselves to becoming better people. Instead of being promiscuous, let us dedicate ourselves to being parents. Instead of being selfish, let us remember that the thing that defines us above all else are our relationships; we must be better husbands and fathers, be more devoted sons, be more respectful brothers. Instead of constantly grasping for more power, let us dedicate ourselves to finding our place in the world, and being the best at it that we can be.\n\nI will only ask one more thing of you, and you should ask it from me, too: let us devote ourselves to creating a society that will make our ancestors proud again! Let us create a better home in the future for our children! Let us create a new Joseon Dynasty, to last five hundred more years!"

    tl_hateplus_message "1-13-H" "japanese" "Royal Wedding" "{a=Tae}Minister Tae{/a}" "3/15 year 1" "zh" "[[Rough outline of the report. Please edit to remove any negative remarks, or any vulgarities that may have slipped in.]\n\nIt was incredibly challenging for the ministry getting such an elaborate ceremony together on short notice, but I'm pretty proud to say that bulk of the royal wedding has gone successfully. All that remains for the ceremony is for the bride to be presented to the Ryu ancestral temple—which thanks to the negligence of the Ministry of State, still hasn't actually finished construction yet. But that one isn't on us.\n\nThe most publicly visible element of the wedding, the induction of the bride by the groom into his home, definitely ended up drawing the crowd we were anticipating; although I have to admit, that {a=OldMute}awful fucking computer girl{/a} would've handled policing the peasants who were there a lot better than whoever the current officer was. And with the peasant class barred from using computers, it's basically a miracle we managed to actually reach as many of them as we did. Even then, I don't think the full weight of how radically different the Confucianized ceremony was really sank in with them. This isn't unexpected, though; as far as I can tell from the reference material that's available in paper books, even our ancestors in the original Joseon Dynasty had a hell of a time educating people on that matter. And thanks to what we know, we're off to a strong start in trying to emulate them.\n\nRegardless, there was a wide range of people in attendance—from peasants to beauties like {a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a} and {a=AejeongsSister}her cute little sister{/a} to {a=Smith}Former Chief Councillor Smith{/a}. And I have no doubt that between the precession and the fabulous traditional royal attire on display, we've made every one of those spectators dream of having a wedding like that. Although I do worry about our historical accuracy when it comes to details like the outfits—anything with photographs in it was lost thanks to that damned traitorous {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a} and her attempted rebellion's total computer wipe—but hopefully our ancestors will forgive any imperfections and instead be happy about at least getting the important parts of the ceremony right.\n\nNow only time will tell whether it will be enough for the Imperial family to lead by example when it comes to promoting proper Confucian weddings, or if it will require further work to finally kill the last corrupt dynasty's tradition of devaluing the groom's importance. If we're going to get the values that we've founded this dynasty on right, then it's absolutely completely and utterly imperative that we get them right starting with marriage.\n\nI don't think it can be stressed enough just how important promoting proper marriage here is; it's the foundation of adulthood, one of the most fundamental of relationships, and the basic unit on which families are built on. And if even nobles don't get how destructive practices that completely skew the dynamic of the relationship—like for instance, the popular occurrence of a groom moving into the bride's home—can be, then we've got a serious problem.\n\nReally, though, time will tell whether that continues to be a problem or not. But as for the ceremony itself, especially the induction of the {a=Euna}queen consort{/a} into the Imperial Palace, it was absolutely gorgeous and powerful and wide-reaching to the people of the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}. And, ancestors willing, it'll be damned well inspiring, too."
    tl_hateplus_message "1-13-I" "japanese" "Funeral for a Rebel" "{a=Euna}Queen Oh Eun-a{/a}" "7/3 year 10" "zh" "Today the former Chief Security Officer of the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}, {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}, passed away, by her own hand. I personally feel uncomfortable making royal proclamations, but the {a=Ryu}Emperor{/a} felt that, to comment on such a difficult and tragic woman as her, it would only be appropriate for me to speak; still, I write these words only very reluctantly.\n\nI don't mean to defend her; her actions were beyond reprehensible, and she thoroughly deserves the title of traitor. But I think it's important that we try to rationally understand what would create such a woman, to learn from her mistakes and not fall victim to them ourselves.\n\n{a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a} was not always a bad person. On the occasions I met her, she was a courteous and respectful person to everyone. She was as devoted to {a=Kim}her husband{/a} as she could be, and a caring mother to {a=Sohi}her daughter{/a}. But as so many women of her time were, she was burdened with far, far too much responsibility, putting long hours into serving the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} and being responsible for hundreds of men under her. Furthermore, she was a woman who had a compulsive emotional need to always be in control, encouraged by her job requiring a great deal of management on her part. We can only imagine how stressful that must have been, to have to split her devotion to two opposing responsibilities like that.\n\nIt's no wonder that a woman who was already so fragile broke when {a=Kim}her husband{/a} died. He was the most important person on the entire ship in her eyes, and she loved him with as much devotion as any wife should. It's only natural she was devastated; without her husband there to keep her grounded, she retreated from domestic life entirely. Tragically, her obsession with control meant that she felt responsible.\n\nI can't imagine how miserable it would have been for her, unable to cope, slowly descending into a madness to desire control beyond her means. She held strong opinions about politics and as so many people of that time did—I will confess there was a time when even I thought it was my place to care about such things—and felt as though if only things were run the way she wanted them to be, it would be better. I still don't think she should be blamed even for that; she was traumatized, after all. Few others have such an excuse for feeling like they should worry about things that are far out of their place.\n\nThe one thing she did have control over, however, were her security men; but she wanted more. She let sorrow turn to ambition, and in the chaos of her attempted coup, her ambition caused extraordinary devastation to our computer system before she was brought under control. I won't dwell on the details of that night, we all know them well; it's not what's important.\n\nWhat's important is to understand that by doing that, that woman's pursuit of ambition caused her to fail in all the things she was entrusted with. She failed in her duty to her direct superior {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, her actions resulting in her death in the end. She failed in her duty as a mother, unable to care for her poor fatherless {a=Sohi}daughter{/a} from prison. And worst of all, she failed {a=Kim}her husband{/a}. Her insistence on unnecessarily having a prominent high-status job meant she made him a target of danger, and meant she had no time to be a good wife. Instead, she went down a path that lead to unhappiness and self-destruction.\n\nIf only she'd been educated better, if only she'd been raised in a better society, perhaps we'd all be better off. When I look at {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}, I don't think of her as a malicious traitor, but as a pitiable woman who forced herself into a position that just wasn't in her nature, and couldn't handle it.\n\nBut she was not a bad person. She did bad things, but she was not a bad person. In the end, she realized the ills of her ways, and in taking her own life, she has brought some measure of dignity back to her family name. It takes braveness to do that. So today, I will admire her for being a woman who was able to admit her faults in the end, and I will endeavour to be more like that.

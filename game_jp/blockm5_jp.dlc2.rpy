Futon still unrolled—not really a point to doing it this late in the day. No dishes in room. That's just about good enough for me.\n\nToday was pretty exhausting at work. We're still doing clean-up from the fire on Monday, and I'm low enough on the ladder to get stuck in a room full of ash all day. It also meant in order to catch up on all my project work, I had to do two hours of overtime afterwards. It was not my idea of fun.\n\nI can't figure out what the occasion is, but for some reason, when I got home from work, half the main branch of the family seemed to be in our living room. Even {a=CouncillorKim}my grandfather{/a}—the Councillor of Engineering himself—was there, shockingly! I wanted to just go lie down and hole up in my room, but given how rare an event that is, social obligations interfered.\n\nAfter thanking {a=CouncillorKim}grandfather{/a} for getting me that job once more—which he seemed nonplussed on the subject of—{a=Grandmother}my grandmother{/a} instantly dominated the conversation by asking me if I'd found a man yet. My standard response: \"I'd love to, but work keeps getting in the way.\" She apparently didn't buy it.\n\n\"Why not? Isn't engineering a male-dominated field?\" she asked. It's not wrong, but nearly every single man is either named Kim, or married to someone named Kim. There's a few exceptions, like my boss—the gross one who forces me to clean up ashes instead of doing important work. I left that last part out in my answer to {a=Grandmother}grandmother{/a}.\n\nIt's not like I don't want to find someone. I'd sure like to move out from my parents' house, and have someone for companionship, and eventually have kids when my career gives me the time for it. I'm not opposed to marriage! I really want it! But I don't think I'm brave enough to say \"the only reason why I've gotten to 22 years old without ever having a boyfriend is because I'm hopeless with men!\" in front of the entire main branch of the family. Or even in front of anyone. I feel pretty embarrassed even writing this in my diary, where nobody but me's going to read it!\n\nSo, I think I was supposed to be offended when she asked \"What if I found someone for you?\" But actually it seemed like a reasonable enough idea. She has good judgement, probably. And I don't believe in nonsense like love at first sight. The idea of getting together with someone through a matchmaker doesn't sound very hard to justify. Besides, if I don't like whoever she picks, I can always just say no.\n\nSo I asked, \"Do you have someone in mind?\" She seemed pretty taken aback by that. My parents, not so much—they didn't say anything.\n\nThe bottom line is that it seems I now have a marriage interview with a {a=Naemun}Mr Pyeon{/a} at some point next month. Apparently he is \"very sweet,\" \"dresses handsomely,\" and works as a cook for a living. Those all sound like good things to me, although I worry about what sort of man would resort to matchmaking. Well, I'm not one to talk. I think it's going to be fairly weird, but I'm looking forward to it."

Closet full of brand new cushions and linens, cupboard full of spotless dishes. Bed is made, {a=Naemun}husband{/a}'s insistence.\n\nHusband. Husband. Husband. What a curious word. I don't think I will ever get used to the idea. I mean, it's only been a day. But \"fiancé\" sounded just as curious to me too. And I don't feel like things are really any different.\n\nAs stated, the wedding was today. {a=Grandmother}Grandmother{/a} insisted on a having a big formal affair of it; certainly not in my interests, but my only condition was that I was to have no part in the planning. It seemed to make both her and {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a} happy. I begrudgingly dealt with the stuffy traditional clothing for her sake; after all, without her matchmaking, I never would have been married to begin with.\n\nIt was evidently in my best interests, though. After the ceremony concluded, I had another chance to converse with my {a=CouncillorKim}grandfather{/a}, and after an entirely accidental slip of the tongue about my disgusting boss (drinking was a factor, I must confess—I am unused to how free it seems to make my tongue), I found myself with a promise of promotion to Technical Specialist. Even for a wedding present, that was a tremendous gesture! I'm intensely looking forward to going back to work now. Finally, freedom from the embarrassment of cleaning ashes, and the ability to perform research! I will, of course, not be given my own assistants from the start, but it is still a huge step up.\n\nWhat else happened? Conversation with parents about moving out was emotional on their part but largely unremarkable. They will cope. Still feel like this new home is too large for me, but it would be a lie to suggest that I don't love it. Having space for just the two of us—particularly, free of awkward silence requirements in the bedroom—is as great as I had hoped.\n\nPast that, busy day, but little else to worth noting. Naked {a=Naemun}husband{/a} is seemingly reading over my shoulder right now.\n\nStill doing it.\n\nHasn't stopped yet.\n\nYes, knock it off.\n\n{a=Naemun}Husband{/a} is now mocking very concept of post-coital diary writing. Seemingly, he does not want me to fall asleep with me showing any manner of affection to him. Possibly even interested in sleeping on futon in other room.

    tl_hateplus_message "6-5-C" "japanese" "The Research Problem" "{a=Soyi}Kim So-yi{/a}" "December 16, 4040" "kr" "Apartment status: no time to make the bed this morning. Otherwise spotless. Dishes need to be washed.\n\n{a=Han}Mr Han{/a} finally responded to my message.\n\nI had been so excited to have him assigned to me as a research assistant. Certainly the help was well-deserved after my recent overburdened workload. Or at least in my estimation. I have considered the possibility the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a}'s intentions were not good in doing so.\n\nIt seems unlikely, however. Despite his remarks on the perilousness of my position, it seems as though he is earnestly grateful for my work. And he didn't assign {a=Han}Han{/a} to me until I specifically outlined the preliminary research proposal into The Radiation Problem. So I must believe that he truly did think the research was worth pursuing, and that I would require assistance for it, and nothing more.\n\nI certainly was optimistic for the first week I worked with {a=Han}Han{/a}. He seemed receptive to my proposal, and having overviewed some of his prior work, he seemed competent enough. During one of our lunch meetings I told him that I'd be interested in discussing his graduate thesis on processor distribution with him, and it sounded fascinating. In retrospect perhaps I should have noticed something in his body language. It did strike me as noteworthy that he touched my hands more than one might expect while making gestures to illustrate his points. But I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nYesterday evening, at his suggestion, I invited him to our apartment to discuss the proposal in depth. It seemed reasonable enough. Or more accurately, I wanted to show off how nice our new apartment is. I haven't had any prior opportunity to do so. Because of that, I went along with his suggestion.\n\nAfter getting tea, I sat down on the couch to show him the proposal document I'd written up. I had to be next to him or he wouldn't be able to see it. After a brief discussion of the general thesis, particularly as to the difficulty in discovering what safe levels of gamma radiation should be when in a closed environment as the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} is, I decided to tell him the more radical part of my theory.\n\n\"Now that there's no risk of a coworker overhearing, I have a confession to make,\" I said to him. He seemed receptive. \"I actually wish to investigate a secondary theory in the bounds of this project: I hypothesize that not only does ambient radiation have a deleterious effect on fertility, but that ambient radiation is outside of safe levels, and therefore it has been a contributing factor to the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}'s declining birth rates. Perhaps the major one,\" I admitted. It was certainly not something I wanted to present to the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a} without being able to provide a connection, but I unreasonably assumed I could trust {a=Han}Han{/a} with it.\n\n\"Well, maybe we could explore that theory together,\" he said in an uncomfortable manner, and put his hand on my leg.\n\nIt felt like he was not taking me seriously and I protested to that effect. \"I'm serious! This may be premature, but I would like to eventually attempt to apply this research to investigate the birth rate problem,\" I said. \"That's dependant on our work in first proving this initial proposal, of course.\"\n\nI can't remember how he responded. But he moved his hand further up my leg. It was inappropriate and felt uncomfortable.\n\n\"Please stop that,\" I told him. He didn't. Unable to think of what to do, I continued talking and hoped he would focus on that instead.\n\n\"This is the preliminary proposal I showed the {a=ResearchChief}Chief{/a},\" I told him, showing him the document. I paged through it until I found the right portion. \"As you can see, the highlighted section is some necessary background detail. Since you are available as an assistant now, I'd like you to—\"\n\nDiary writing is supposed to be cathartic, but I am finding this difficult to write about. Maybe tea will help.\n\nAt that point, I was cut off mid-sentence by the insertion of his hand into my underwear. This was far beyond the point of uncomfortable.\n\n\"I'd like you to—\", I started, but was interrupted by another movement. It was at this time that I realized that he would not stop on his own. I had no idea what to say. It did not seem likely to me that I could think of anything to make him stop.\n\n\"Please stop,\" I said anyway. He didn't, and when I said that, I saw that he was staring at me. I was not able to decipher the expression—not an unusual occurrence with me—but it scared me and I looked away on reflex.\n\nI tried to figure out what I had done to elicit this. I am not great with most social interactions, and I considered the possibility that I had somehow signalled that this was what I wanted. Maybe it was the invitation home that triggered it. Maybe. I could not figure out what I had done wrong at the time and I am still struggling.\n\nFinally, after enduring it for far too long, I decided I would try to pull myself away. Then I ran, out of the room, out of my own home, into the corridor. Even at the time it occurred to me to be thankful that he let me run. He could have easily overpowered me. Ever since I first had that thought, I am having a hard time not imagining what that would be like, and it induces a sense of nausea. I would go so far as to characterize the thought as horrifying. I would like to stop thinking about it.\n\nI hid at the office for two hours, pretending to be doing overtime. Nobody questioned it anyway. The thought occurred to me that I could have simply hidden in another room of my home—the bedroom and washroom doors both lock—but it was too late then. From the office, I wrote him a message, telling him that it would be in both our best interests if we mentioned the incident to nobody, and I told the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a} that his help was unnecessary. It took many rephrasings until I had something I was satisfied with to send {a=Han}Han{/a}. I ended up phrasing it as a threat. I could only hope it would be taken seriously.\n\nRealistically I could have probably waited a shorter period than two hours to return, but I wanted to be certain he'd be gone when I got back. Thankfully, he was. Instead, {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a} was there to greet me.\n\n\"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" he asked immediately after welcoming me home. I do not know how he could tell something was wrong. I said nothing. I couldn't tell him about it. There was no way. I'm unworried about him judging me, or blaming me, but regardless I do not think he would understand. Probably he would want to cause a commotion over it. File a complaint, or some equally troublesome gesture. \"You look really upset. Do you… want to talk about it?\" he asked.\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Okay. Of course, that's fine. Give you a hug, at least?\" he offered.\n\nI nodded, and he hugged me. I had only nodded reluctantly. I had thought, I really did not want anyone to touch me after that whole incident, the idea of a man touching me just made me uncomfortable to think of. Yet when he put his arms around me, despite that thought, I ended up gripping him very, very tightly, and held on for far longer than is considered normal. I realized it wasn't the same thing at all, my reluctance was unfounded. Being held like that could not have been any more different. I am not really certain as to how to describe it, so all I can say is that it made me feel safe. I felt a sense of longing to just stay like that forever.\n\n\"I'll make dinner for you, sweetie,\" he offered. \"How about soft tofu stew, extra spicy, just for you? That'll make you feel better.\" I doubted that any food would have that power, but offering to make my favourite for me was a very sweet gesture. I'm glad he's here.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\n\n\"Just sit back and relax, okay? I'll have some tea for you in a moment,\" he told me.\n\nAs it turned out, dinner was lovely and did raise my mood. The thought of {a=Han}Han{/a} touching me kept coming back to me, as I suspect it will for a long time, but then being able to look at my caring husband comes as a source of great comfort.\n\nAfter dinner, {a=Han}Mr Han{/a} finally responded to my message.\n\nHe was threatening in tone in his response, and implied both that I made the first move with him and that he could use that as blackmail material with my husband if he so wished, but ultimately agreed to the terms I laid out. I sent a short, one word response: \"okay.\" The suggestions he made were frustrating, and it makes me wish I could respond harshly to him, tell him how wrong and bad he's being, but engaging with him more won't make anything better. I just want to forget about the whole thing. Fighting would be counterproductive to that goal, not to mention massively wasting of time when I am already overburdened at work. So I sent that message, and instead put down all my feelings here, where nobody else will see.\n\nAnd now I will wash the dishes with {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a}, because I am tired of dwelling on this."

Floors probably need to be swept at some point this week. I'll do it when I'm less annoyed.\n\nIn the past month, in addition to the research work that is in my actual job description, I have organized three successful maintenance projects, compiled over a dozen sets of minutes, and learned a recently-resigned secretary's filing system in order to explain to a coworker. To say nothing of the many smaller contributions I have been asked to make, all of which unrelated to my research. This is the hardest I have worked in my life, and I am proud of what I have done.\n\nDespite this, today I had to take a pay cut. When I was called into the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a}'s office I expected the opposite. A commendation for exemplary work would have been warranted. Some manner of praise. (Given the current economic circumstances, a promotion would have been unlikely. Regardless of the fact that it is very much due.) Instead, my hourly pay will be reduced by 10%, effective immediately.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's nothing personal,\" he told me. \"Just between you and me, I've been really impressed by your work. I appreciate it and all. I'm afraid it's just a matter of department-wide policy; we've been asked to cut costs on all high-risk employees and put them towards training costs. I'm sure you understand.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I do not understand. Elaborate. In what manner am I 'high-risk?'\"\n\n\"It means at risk of quitting. I mean, really… it's because you've got more options now, we have to compensate for that somehow. Lately, because of the whole motherhood credit thing, we've been losing a lot of highly-qualified women… I mean, I'm sure you understand,\" he said. I didn't. \"If you decide to quit and have children, it's going to be expensive to train a replacement. Especially one as qualified as you!\"\n\n\"I have no intention of having children at 24,\" I told him. \"Or at any other point in the foreseeable future. The concern is unwarranted.\"\n\n\"Well… statistically speaking, as a married woman, you are. Personally, I believe you, because I know you well! I'm sure you're not lying. But I can't make an exception for anyone who says that—if I did, anyone could say that, and we'd still have a huge problem.\"\n\nI was unable to think of anything appropriate to say. I found the suggestion upsetting.\n\n\"I mean, you can see the logic in that, right? I can show you the actuarial reports if you'd like,\" he offered.\n\n\"Please do that,\" I said. After I returned home from work I had a chance to review them, and unsurprisingly, they are consistent with what he had said. I could find no grounds under which to criticize their numbers. It seemed to be based on solid research.\n\n\"But if you think it all checks out… you'll understand that it's fair, right? That's just how it goes, statistically speaking,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't argue with the logic,\" I finally admitted. I hoped that when I got home, the reports would be problematic and I could criticize them.\n\n\"I knew you'd be rational about it,\" he told me. \"That's why I'm glad you're still with us; you're definitely a logic-minded person, you understand how statistics work. And really, given how hard you work… I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't just a temporary loss. You're well on the way for a promotion.\"\n\nI was uncertain as to how to argue with that, too. I was intended to take it as a compliment and so it seemed like the only thing to do. He was right, of course. I could see the logic and I am unable to argue with it. Seeing the logic has yet to have any mitigating effect on my annoyance at the matter, however."

Dishes need to be washed, and broken mixing bowl needs replacing. Floor needs to be swept.\n\nIn retrospect I suppose it was an inevitability. For the last month I was the only woman in the department still left, excluding custodial services and the like. Certainly the last with any sort of engineering qualifications at all. Most quit. My mother tells me that all of them are pregnant now. I didn't realize my position might be in peril; I assumed I would continue to work in engineering forever, even given the pay cuts. Considering the possibility that I am actually a naïve idiot.\n\nYesterday I delivered my report on The Radiation Problem to the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a}. The entire presentation took an hour, covering most of the material in the 100 page report, and he seemed to find my conclusions both reasonable and useful. At least, he said as much. And he was taking notes the whole time. He seemed satisfied that I had proven the hypothesis, that increased levels of ambient radiation had a negative impact on fertility rates. \"I would like to extend this research further,\" I told him. \"I have reason to believe that not only could it hypothetically have an impact, but that the low birth rates on the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} are related to ambient radiation being outside safe levels. I think understanding this could be the first step in addressing a serious problem.\"\n\n\"Well, hold off on the proposal for now, but I'll think about it. That's an interesting theory. I don't know if there's really room for funding that, but I do see the importance,\" he said to me.\n\nI do not understand why he did, because near the end of the day, I got the message from him saying that I was fired effective the end of tomorrow. I feel as though I should have seen it coming. I suppose the friendliness was cowardice and an unwillingness to deliver the message to my face. I feel betrayed by his actions.\n\nWhile I was sitting there, stunned, {a=Han}Han{/a} walked into my office. I glared at him. He told me that my replacement had yet to be decided and that he wanted me to put his name in as the most qualified. I glared at him more, speechless that he would suggest such a thing.\n\n\"If you don't, I'll tell {a=Naemun}your husband{/a} that you—\" and then he made a vulgar hand gesture towards his mouth. I was sickened. I was angry. My boss treating me as though I had no value was bad enough, but to be blackmailed by someone like {a=Han}Han{/a} was beyond reproach. I am still angry thinking about it, actually. I wanted to tell him to leave me alone, that I never would. What I really wanted to say was \"fuck off!\" I tried. I was unable to work up the nerve. All I could do was log off my workstation for the last time, and watch the image of {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a} on the desk fade away. I did not want him to see it. I tried to storm out of the office, but he grabbed me by the arm. He said that he meant what he said in a threatening tone.\n\nI didn't care anymore.\n\n\"Do what you will,\" I choked out, and yanked my arm away. I hurried out, not caring what people thought as I left the department looking upset. His threats were disgusting but at that moment I felt like they held no power. I had already lost my job, the most important thing to me. If I have no purpose, it is hard to be afraid.\n\nI feel stupid and naïve for not realizing. The timing could not have been a coincidence, being fired right after delivering my last report. Maybe I should have held on to the report, stalled. Maybe I should have known how precarious my position was. I am an idiot.\n\nLate evening addendum to this diary entry:\n\n{a=Naemun}My husband{/a} was very nice and supportive when I delivered the news to him. \"I have one more day, but I do not think I'll go in,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, hell no, of course not! Those bastards don't deserve that,\" he said, putting his hand on my shoulder. \"You're so tense. I mean, of course you are, I'm sorry, dear… turn a bit? I'll give you a massage.\" I obliged, and he started to rub my shoulders.\n\n\"Ah,\" I said. It felt nice. \"Thank you.\" I didn't know what else to say.\n\n\"Can you ask your family for help? Maybe there's something they can do about your bo— your {a=ResearchChief}old boss{/a}, I mean,\" he suggested. He was trying to be helpful, but it unfortunately was not.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's wanted to throw around much influence since the family lost the councillorship. There's complicated politics involved. I don't understand them, really,\" I told him. \"I'll ask my dad, but I am very confident that it won't help.\"\n\n\"That sucks,\" he said bluntly. I agreed with the assessment.\n\n\"I do not know what I'm going to do with my life now,\" I sighed and admitted. \"That job was everything, and I am hardly qualified to do anything else. Everyone else is settling down and having kids, but…\" I trailed off. I did not want to offend him by suggesting I did not want to have kids with him. Which is not to say that I do, but I am young, and I am sure I'll change my mind in the future. Most people seem to, and I would not assume I am any different. But right now I cannot imagine it.\n\nThankfully, he understood.\n\n\"No, no, of course not, honey, there's no rush,\" he said, hugging me tightly. \"Only when you're ready. What do you want to do now, dear? I mean, if you didn't have to worry about jobs or money or anything, what would you be doing?\"\n\n\"Well... my research is very important. I do not believe anybody else will conduct it, and I think the continued existence of {i}Mugunghwa{/i} society depends on dealing with the problem. But right now it's not even accepted that there is one,\" I said. \"I would continue working on it regardless. It is that important.\"\n\n\"Then you should keep doing it, if it's that important to you. You're a tough girl, I believe in you,\" he said to me. It means a lot to me that he says those things.\n\nI turned around, sat on his lap, and hugged him. \"Thank you for saying that. I do not know what I would do without you.\" He kissed me on the forehead, a gesture that I appreciated a great deal. \"You're right. I am tough. It's important work. I have to keep at it even without an official budget. The future of the ship is at stake.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe in you, sweetie,\" he said.\n\nI truly do not know what I would do without that man in my life. He does not really understand the importance of what I was talking about, I know. I have tried to explain without any success. But he is very kind and supports me regardless, and I have come to realize that is more important. If I was still single, alone, when I received news I was fired, I do not know what I would do. I would still be alone in my room, crying helplessly, I have no doubt. I would have no determination. It is only because of his words that I am convinced that I must persevere.\n\nYes, dear, I mean it. Even if I don't like you reading over my shoulder while I'm writing (he is doing this right now), I will certainly acknowledge that you are the greatest thing in my life, and that I am very happy to have married you. Oh, certainly. Feel free to squeeze me tighter. But right now I am going to start transferring documents from work, such that I can start planning to continue my research on The Radiation Problem from home.\n\nI feel freshly inspired. I may be a naïve idiot, but I am determined, and I have confidence that I will be able to prove my case."

You said I could always write you for advice, no matter how weird it was, so… well, I'm calling you on that. It's about {a=Soyi}my wife{/a}. I don't know what the hell is up with her, and, well, you've met her, you know how quiet she is, it's impossible to get her to actually tell me what's wrong. I'm really worried about her and I don't know what to do.\n\nHere's some backstory: you know her, she's always been weird and introverted. It's charming, most of the time. Ever since she lost her job, though, it's been dialed up to 11. I encouraged her to take up this science project of hers right after because I figured she needed something to ease the transition, but… it's been over a year now! I thought she would've found another job outside of engineering, or better yet, decide she's ready to have kids. (Not just because of the motherhood credit, but given the extra hours I'm pulling to compensate, we sure could use it.) I mean, it's not like I didn't know what I was getting into, marrying a girl 15 years younger than me. But the obsession can't be healthy.\n\nWhat happened a couple days ago really freaked me out, and still does. I get home at 9, as usual, expecting to see her working on whatever it is that she's working on, or watching a drama, or something. Instead she's in the kitchen, on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor violently. And, I mean, our kitchen really is a mess. Everything in the apartment is a mess. I'd clean it myself if I wasn't so dead exhausted after 12-hour work days. It looked like she had put in a serious effort into cleaning up, which seemed good, except actually looking at her, she really didn't look okay at all.\n\nThen she looks up at me, and suddenly starts to cry. \"Be honest me with me. I'm worthless, aren't I?\" she asks me, totally out of nowhere. What the hell do you say to that?\n\n\"Of course not!\" I told her as immediately as I could. If she heard me, she didn't show any sign of it.\n\n\"I know I'm worthless as an engineer, or I would not have been fired. I'm worthless as a scientist, or my work would receive attention from people,\" she whimpered. \"I'm worthless as a wife, too, aren't I?\"\n\n\"You're not, sweetie,\" I told her. I got her to get up and sit on the couch with me, because discussing things with her on the floor would just be impossible. I tried doing the usual thing, where I hug her and rub her shoulders, but it didn't seem to help this time. Neither did arguing with her.\n\n\"Our apartment is a disaster. If I were better, it'd be clean, wouldn't it? You are surely disappointed about that,\" she said.\n\n\"You've been busy,\" I told her. I don't really understand why she hasn't been able to find the time, but I could hardly say \"yes\", could I?\n\n\"We never eat together, either. We rarely talk. This is the most we've said to each other all month. It's my fault,\" she said.\n\nDo you have any idea what to say to that? I have no idea how you're supposed to reassure women when they're telling the truth like that. I mean, I knew I couldn't agree, but all I could think to say was \"No, it's not,\" which is pretty lame.\n\n\"How long prior was the last time we even had sex? I'm worthless that way, too,\" she said.\n\n\"Well… something's been on your mind the last few times we tried. It's okay, there's no pressure. Besides, it's not like we're newlyweds.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter! That's no excuse…\" she said. \"Or have you just given up on me? You have given up on me, haven't you?\"\n\n\"I—\" I tried to say something, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I really am worthless!\" she cried. \"And now I am merely wasting your time with whining, aren't I?\"\n\n\"You're not worthless. And you can always talk to me. That's what I'm here for,\" I responded. It sounded pathetic the moment I said it.\n\n\"What if I started cooking dinner for you? If I am spending all my time at home, I merely… should be carrying my own weight,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't know how to cook, sweetie. And that's fine.\"\n\n\"I truly am worthless!\" she said loudly, and started to cry again.\n\nI was at a loss, and frankly, I'm still not sure if what I said was the right thing. It sounded idiotic at the time and it sounds that way now, even though it got her to stop crying. If you know what I should've said, though, I'm all ears.\n\n\"You can help out more with the cleaning, if you want, though. It would be nice. It looks like you've already done a lot of hard work, and I really appreciate that, dear. And if you want to… er, you know… I'm not going to complain,\" I stumbled over my words like an idiot. An idiot whose idea of comforting {a=Soyi}his wife{/a} is telling her to clean up and have sex with him. What the hell. Even if it did get her to stop crying. I don't know, I'm bad with women. Clearly.\n\n\"I can do that! I'd like to! It would make me feel less worthless,\" she said. \"And besides, I'm your wife.\"\n\nThen she wiped her tears from her eyes, and gave me a really intense look. \"Do… you want to?\" she asked. I'm not a young man anymore, it's not like that's really something I had in mind, especially seeing her like that, but how could I say no?\n\nShe kissed me, and I got into it soon enough. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I dislike kissing my cute 20-something wife and her soft lips. It's just the circumstances, you know? Sex is supposed to be all about connecting people, but it just made me think that I don't really get her. I have no idea what had triggered this. It's really hard not to think about what's going on in her head while she was doing that, and hell if I know.\n\nMaybe it's not so bad, though. It felt like she had passion again, at least. I guess it's because she felt like she had to overcompensate, but she took the lead, guiding my hand up her skirt. At the risk of being too graphic, she held my hand while I played with her, and kissed me gently. It seemed very sweet of her.\n\nAfter that, she went down on me. I didn't really think anything about it while she was doing it, for obvious reasons, but after she was done, she sat on my lap and held my wrist tightly. And it occurred to me that this was the first time she'd given head in years. I really hope it wasn't for my sake. I don't know. Her eyes were still watering at that point, but she also refused to let go. I don't know what the hell to make of that.\n\nIt's been a couple days and now the apartment is pretty much all clean. She took it really seriously, I guess. I'm still really worried about her. Even after that, we haven't communicated any better. If she feels worthless, is a clean apartment really going to make her feel like she has value again? I mean, I know she does, I just don't know how to convince her of it.\n\n…on the other hand, I just realized the one thing right now that I didn't say to her. And I should go do that. So never mind, I guess, I don't need to send this letter after all. Which is good, because it'd make the next family gathering weird if talking to {a=Soyi}my wife{/a} just made you think of your old brother's manhood. That would be gross. I mean, I sure don't want to think about yours, either.\n\nAnyway, now I'm going to go tell her what she really needs to hear: that she should keep on doing her science thing, whatever the hell it is. That's probably the thing that'll make her feel like she's not worthless. If she believes it's important, that's what she should dedicate herself to doing. That's less awkward and weird than household cleaning and sex, at least. I'll tell her that I'll keep supporting her in her struggle with that. I think that's what she was looking for this whole time.\n\nI'm glad I realized that.\n\nLove, (even though I'm not sending this,)\n{a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a}"

The ship sailed on getting that one right a long time ago.]\n\nApartment status: bed is made. A few dishes need to be washed. Take-out containers need to be taken to garbage. Floor is clean.\n\nAfter two years without any sort of breakthrough, and dozens of appeals without any form of acknowledgement, I believe I have discovered the evidence that I need to provide definitive proof.\n\nThere has always been a bizarre family legend of an eccentric-but-brilliant ancient Earthborn ancestor who saved his terminally ill daughter through unconventional methods. In some tellings, she is a ghost that lives in the computer. In others, she is sealed away in an \"alternate dimension,\" to return when the ship has landed on a planet with fresh air.\n\nI learned the truth from {a=Grandmother}my grandmother{/a} at the New Year's gathering. In reality, she does exist, and is merely in cryonic sleep in the family's storage closet. I caught a glimpse of her at that gathering, and realized that she was the key to proving my thesis. Today, I returned with {a=Naemun}my husband{/a} to their home, having offered her a great-grandchildren-related bribe in order to have access to the sleeping {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a} to run tests.\n\nMy theory is: as she has not consumed food or water, or breathed air, in nearly 1600 years, if there has been a significant increase in ambient radiation in that duration, she should be significantly less affected by it. Her chamber was sealed partially by glass, so she may not be completely unaffected, but I anticipate that the difference will be readily observable. The technology involved in her preservation seems extraordinarily designed. I can believe that it came from the same level of Earthborn brilliance that built our ship.\n\nWhile {a=Naemun}my husband{/a} was gracefully distracting my grandparents by listening to their stories, I set up in the storage closet, attempting to open the capsule labelled \"{a=Hyunae}Kim Hyun-ae, Pale Bride{/a}.\"\n\nThis action was easier said than done. A separate, hacked-together computer was regulating the capsule, but the labeled switch for opening it was non-operational. It took a significant while to figure out that I needed to connect a secondary battery, and insert an override key, to enable the switch. It did not help that I was very trepidatious to fiddle with Earthborn-designed technology that was completely over my head. Accidentally causing damage with my clumsiness would have been disastrous.\n\nThe warm-up cycle took a good ten minutes. As I watched her, I became very aware of the fact that she was a real girl. A very old one. An orphan who lost her family centuries ago, who likely had her own hopes and dreams. I found myself hoping that one day we would find a way to let her live the rest of her life, although given the state of modern medicine, optimism would be sadly unfounded.\n\nEven after she was brought back to life by the machine, she did not actually awaken, going from a near-dead state to merely sleeping. She looked very peaceful. I tried not to disturb her too badly when I took a small sample of her blood. Still, she started to open her eyes, mumbling quietly.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Go back to sleep, little one,\" I said, touching her face gently. \"It's not time to wake up yet.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" she murmured, and she closed her eyes again.\n\nI suddenly felt guilty, and quickly put her back into the freeze where she belonged. It is justifiable, of course. She remains unharmed, and will continue to rest peacefully. I doubt she will think of it as anything more than a brief dream. And regardless of any discomfort I caused that poor child, proving my hypothesis may be necessary for ensuring that society thrives until the future where she might awaken.\n\nAfterwards I rescued {a=Naemun}my brave husband{/a} and let my grandparents pester me about our family plans instead. I did not mind talking to them, and they discussed things more freely than the usual tone at large family gatherings. I was very alarmed to discover just how badly even the main branch had been doing over the past couple years. Losing the councillorship and therefore nobility status has had a great impact on everyone, not just me, although I still feel my situation is worse.\n\nHopefully, however, that situation will only be temporary. If the data received from analyzing the {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a}'s blood sample supports my theory, and I am confident it will, it should give it enough strength that I will be taken seriously again. Things may not improve in the short term. But they will, eventually. Of this I have confidence."

The act of cleaning is a futile gesture against a human-generated form of entropy, and entropy invariably wins in the end. My attempts to make order out of chaos have been futile. I give up!\n\nMoving in has been completed. Not that it was a very long process. We only have two rooms now, and they're not very big. I wish we had moved in with my parents, instead. If only we had swallowed our pride sooner, but instead my sister beat me to it, so now I am stuck living with my in-laws in their garishly decorated home.\n\nI do not wish to mention it to {a=Naemun}my husband{/a}, because I appreciate the economic circumstances that necessitated our move and do not wish to seem ungrateful for the support they are providing by renting us the space, but I do not like my in-laws at all. My mother- and father-in-law are old enough to be my grandparents, which is fine, however I find them to not be friendly. They are not rude, they simply do not speak to me, ever. My brother-in-law seems friendly, and very spirited, but to me he never says anything and immediately excuses himself from any conversation I attempt to start.\n\nI believe they are afraid of me. I do not understand why, and I wish I knew what it was that I have done to inspire such feelings in them. I find it very hurtful to be surrounded by people but have them willfully ignore me for reasons unknown. I stay in the bedroom as much as possible as a result. We have a computer screen next to our bed, anyway, so it is sufficient for me to work from. If I bury myself in work, I can ignore those feelings.\n\nThankfully, work continues at a good pace again. It took much longer than anticipated, but I was finally able to use my old professor's equipment at Mugunghwa University to perform tests on the {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a}'s blood. The results are unsurprising and the proof is unequivocal. Ambient radiation on the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} truly is much higher than the standard baseline. The current levels are not normal, and with minimal massaging of the data, a linear direct correlation with birth rates and ambient radiation extrapolated from current levels and the {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a}'s blood can be demonstrated.\n\nThere is no doubt: our society is being killed slowly by infertility caused by increased radiation levels. When my report is complete, I will certainly be able to present it, and I have no doubt it will be taken seriously. I merely have to get through this, finish all this work, and finally I will be able to get my life back on track."

I had to get someone else to submit it for me, but finally my work is starting to pay off: I have an audience with the {a=CouncillorHan}Councillor of Engineering{/a} to present the matter for his consideration. I was so happy to write the recommendations section, however. Thinking about the future, and how I could do work that was actually recognized as valuable, and help safeguard the ship's future, it makes me feel as though I have a purpose once more. It is a feeling I have forgotten over these past few years, but I would like to remember it again.\n\n{a=Naemun}My husband{/a} does not share my optimism. Things have been strained with us as of late. We have never been able to communicate under the best of circumstances, but even more now, I feel as though there is a wedge between us. When I told him about having a chance to prove myself, and how I was looking forward to the future, he just seemed upset. I wanted him to be proud of me for making it this far, despite all the difficulties. I wanted him to be as supportive of me as he was from the start.\n\n\"I want to feel like I'm not doing this alone,\" I pleaded with him as we got ready for bed.\n\n\"What are you going to do if they ignore you after all that? What if they don't go through with what you want? What then?\" he asked me. He seemed disappointed. \"Have you even considered that possibility?\"\n\n\"It's unlikely. The data is irrefutable, and easy to understand. Radiation is unquestionably the cause of decreased fertility on the {i}Mugunghwa{/i},\" I told him. \"I have confidence that no reasonable person could disregard my report.\"\n\n\"Fine! I'm sure it is, I just…\" he trailed off. \"I don't care. I'm going to bed now.\" He turned his back on me.\n\n\"Wait!\" I said, hurrying over to sit in front of him. \"What if I did make plans for the extremely unlikely event that things do not work out? Would that make you happy?\"\n\n\"Forget it!\" he said, annoyed.\n\n\"I mean it,\" I said. \"I do not want to be the cause of you being upset. I want things to be amicable between us again. I am willing to make contingencies for things that I do not believe will occur if it is something that will make you happy.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the hell that means. You're doing that thing where you talk over my head, and I hate that,\" he scowled.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"If you want me to consider that things might not work out, I will consider it. Let's consider it. I don't think it'll happen. But there is no harm in considering it.\"\n\n\"What's the point? I'm sure you'll find some smart-talking way around it in the end, anyway, so you can just go back your self-obsessed science project shit in the end. You always do,\" he said angrily.\n\n\"Please don't say that!\" I said, my voice quavering. \"You're my husband! I love you more than anything. Please, don't you stop taking me seriously, too!\"\n\nHe looked away, and there was a long pause. I felt like crying, when just minutes before I was so happy. Eventually, he made eye contact with me. He seemed to be confused.\n\n\"…sorry,\" he said in a sheepish manner. \"Do you really mean that? You love me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" I stated.\n\n\"…you've never said that to me before,\" he said. I was skeptical.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm absolutely positive,\" he told me. I was sure he was wrong, but as he had just apologized to me, I saw no reason to worsen things by arguing.\n\n\"Well, I do,\" I said. \"I love you very much.\"\n\n\"Come here, you,\" he said, grabbing me, pulling me onto his lap, just like the old days. He hugged me, and I was unable to stop myself from crying at that moment. \"What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" I told him.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.\n\n\"Let's make fallback plans,\" I said. \"In case I am unable to convince them, what would you like?\"\n\nHe was quiet for a moment. \"I want to have kids,\" he said. \"Not just because it would help with the money. I just want to have kids. I want to have a girl. An adorable little girl, who will be smart and pretty and dedicated, just like her mother. After that, maybe we can have a couple of boys. She'll have to learn to keep them in line, but I can teach her that. And you can teach her science.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I said.\n\n\"You promise?\" he asked. \"After all this is done, if your presentation doesn't lead to a job, you promise me you'll settle down and we'll try to have kids?\"\n\n\"I can make no promises with regards to gender. But I promise, if my presentation is unsuccessful, I will give up, and we will try to have kids,\" I said.\n\nIt seemed to comfort him a great deal. I felt guilty, and hoped that he did not have his hopes up. It is unlikely that the report will be ignored, so I will not be following through on that promise. In the future, maybe we will anyway, but it was a promise that would not lead to anything, because I am certain that I will be very busy with work in the future. I hope it does not disappoint him.\n\nI am happy now, though, and I am optimistic for the future. I have an audience that will lead to something being done about our society's greatest problem, and with the irrefutable and extensive proof I have compiled, I will be taken seriously again. In just a matter of days, I will be on track again.\n\nI am also happy because after I promised that, he took me by the chin, smiled, and said to me: \"I'm going to hold you to that. I'm also going to kiss you now.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I'd like that,\" I told him. When he did, I had never felt such relief in my life. I had my husband caring about me again, and I had a future. I had value and a purpose, and finally, it will not just be me repeating these things to myself. I have persevered for so long, and soon it will pay off, in just a matter of days. \n\nI also enjoyed the kiss aside from its symbolic meaning. It simply felt very nice. I could have melted in his arms right there.\n\nI am certain of it: everything will be alright."

Futon still unrolled—not really a point to doing it this late in the day. No dishes in room. That's just about good enough for me.\n\nToday was pretty exhausting at work. We're still doing clean-up from the fire on Monday, and I'm low enough on the ladder to get stuck in a room full of ash all day. It also meant in order to catch up on all my project work, I had to do two hours of overtime afterwards. It was not my idea of fun.\n\nI can't figure out what the occasion is, but for some reason, when I got home from work, half the main branch of the family seemed to be in our living room. Even {a=CouncillorKim}my grandfather{/a}—the Councillor of Engineering himself—was there, shockingly! I wanted to just go lie down and hole up in my room, but given how rare an event that is, social obligations interfered.\n\nAfter thanking {a=CouncillorKim}grandfather{/a} for getting me that job once more—which he seemed nonplussed on the subject of—{a=Grandmother}my grandmother{/a} instantly dominated the conversation by asking me if I'd found a man yet. My standard response: \"I'd love to, but work keeps getting in the way.\" She apparently didn't buy it.\n\n\"Why not? Isn't engineering a male-dominated field?\" she asked. It's not wrong, but nearly every single man is either named Kim, or married to someone named Kim. There's a few exceptions, like my boss—the gross one who forces me to clean up ashes instead of doing important work. I left that last part out in my answer to {a=Grandmother}grandmother{/a}.\n\nIt's not like I don't want to find someone. I'd sure like to move out from my parents' house, and have someone for companionship, and eventually have kids when my career gives me the time for it. I'm not opposed to marriage! I really want it! But I don't think I'm brave enough to say \"the only reason why I've gotten to 22 years old without ever having a boyfriend is because I'm hopeless with men!\" in front of the entire main branch of the family. Or even in front of anyone. I feel pretty embarrassed even writing this in my diary, where nobody but me's going to read it!\n\nSo, I think I was supposed to be offended when she asked \"What if I found someone for you?\" But actually it seemed like a reasonable enough idea. She has good judgement, probably. And I don't believe in nonsense like love at first sight. The idea of getting together with someone through a matchmaker doesn't sound very hard to justify. Besides, if I don't like whoever she picks, I can always just say no.\n\nSo I asked, \"Do you have someone in mind?\" She seemed pretty taken aback by that. My parents, not so much—they didn't say anything.\n\nThe bottom line is that it seems I now have a marriage interview with a {a=Naemun}Mr Pyeon{/a} at some point next month. Apparently he is \"very sweet,\" \"dresses handsomely,\" and works as a cook for a living. Those all sound like good things to me, although I worry about what sort of man would resort to matchmaking. Well, I'm not one to talk. I think it's going to be fairly weird, but I'm looking forward to it."

Dishes need to be washed.\n\n{a=Han}Mr Han{/a} finally responded to my message.\n\nI had been so excited to have him assigned to me as a research assistant. Certainly the help was well-deserved after my recent overburdened workload. Or at least in my estimation. I have considered the possibility the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a}'s intentions were not good in doing so.\n\nIt seems unlikely, however. Despite his remarks on the perilousness of my position, it seems as though he is earnestly grateful for my work. And he didn't assign {a=Han}Han{/a} to me until I specifically outlined the preliminary research proposal into The Radiation Problem. So I must believe that he truly did think the research was worth pursuing, and that I would require assistance for it, and nothing more.\n\nI certainly was optimistic for the first week I worked with {a=Han}Han{/a}. He seemed receptive to my proposal, and having overviewed some of his prior work, he seemed competent enough. During one of our lunch meetings I told him that I'd be interested in discussing his graduate thesis on processor distribution with him, and it sounded fascinating. In retrospect perhaps I should have noticed something in his body language. It did strike me as noteworthy that he touched my hands more than one might expect while making gestures to illustrate his points. But I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nYesterday evening, at his suggestion, I invited him to our apartment to discuss the proposal in depth. It seemed reasonable enough. Or more accurately, I wanted to show off how nice our new apartment is. I haven't had any prior opportunity to do so. Because of that, I went along with his suggestion.\n\nAfter getting tea, I sat down on the couch to show him the proposal document I'd written up. I had to be next to him or he wouldn't be able to see it. After a brief discussion of the general thesis, particularly as to the difficulty in discovering what safe levels of gamma radiation should be when in a closed environment as the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} is, I decided to tell him the more radical part of my theory.\n\n\"Now that there's no risk of a coworker overhearing, I have a confession to make,\" I said to him. He seemed receptive. \"I actually wish to investigate a secondary theory in the bounds of this project: I hypothesize that not only does ambient radiation have a deleterious effect on fertility, but that ambient radiation is outside of safe levels, and therefore it has been a contributing factor to the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}'s declining birth rates. Perhaps the major one,\" I admitted. It was certainly not something I wanted to present to the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a} without being able to provide a connection, but I unreasonably assumed I could trust {a=Han}Han{/a} with it.\n\n\"Well, maybe we could explore that theory together,\" he said in an uncomfortable manner, and put his hand on my leg.\n\nIt felt like he was not taking me seriously and I protested to that effect. \"I'm serious! This may be premature, but I would like to eventually attempt to apply this research to investigate the birth rate problem,\" I said. \"That's dependant on our work in first proving this initial proposal, of course.\"\n\nI can't remember how he responded. But he moved his hand further up my leg. It was inappropriate and felt uncomfortable.\n\n\"Please stop that,\" I told him. He didn't. Unable to think of what to do, I continued talking and hoped he would focus on that instead.\n\n\"This is the preliminary proposal I showed the {a=ResearchChief}Chief{/a},\" I told him, showing him the document. I paged through it until I found the right portion. \"As you can see, the highlighted section is some necessary background detail. Since you are available as an assistant now, I'd like you to—\"\n\nDiary writing is supposed to be cathartic, but I am finding this difficult to write about. Maybe tea will help.\n\nAt that point, I was cut off mid-sentence by the insertion of his hand into my underwear. This was far beyond the point of uncomfortable.\n\n\"I'd like you to—\", I started, but was interrupted by another movement. It was at this time that I realized that he would not stop on his own. I had no idea what to say. It did not seem likely to me that I could think of anything to make him stop.\n\n\"Please stop,\" I said anyway. He didn't, and when I said that, I saw that he was staring at me. I was not able to decipher the expression—not an unusual occurrence with me—but it scared me and I looked away on reflex.\n\nI tried to figure out what I had done to elicit this. I am not great with most social interactions, and I considered the possibility that I had somehow signalled that this was what I wanted. Maybe it was the invitation home that triggered it. Maybe. I could not figure out what I had done wrong at the time and I am still struggling.\n\nFinally, after enduring it for far too long, I decided I would try to pull myself away. Then I ran, out of the room, out of my own home, into the corridor. Even at the time it occurred to me to be thankful that he let me run. He could have easily overpowered me. Ever since I first had that thought, I am having a hard time not imagining what that would be like, and it induces a sense of nausea. I would go so far as to characterize the thought as horrifying. I would like to stop thinking about it.\n\nI hid at the office for two hours, pretending to be doing overtime. Nobody questioned it anyway. The thought occurred to me that I could have simply hidden in another room of my home—the bedroom and washroom doors both lock—but it was too late then. From the office, I wrote him a message, telling him that it would be in both our best interests if we mentioned the incident to nobody, and I told the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a} that his help was unnecessary. It took many rephrasings until I had something I was satisfied with to send {a=Han}Han{/a}. I ended up phrasing it as a threat. I could only hope it would be taken seriously.\n\nRealistically I could have probably waited a shorter period than two hours to return, but I wanted to be certain he'd be gone when I got back. Thankfully, he was. Instead, {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a} was there to greet me.\n\n\"Are you okay, sweetheart?\" he asked immediately after welcoming me home. I do not know how he could tell something was wrong. I said nothing. I couldn't tell him about it. There was no way. I'm unworried about him judging me, or blaming me, but regardless I do not think he would understand. Probably he would want to cause a commotion over it. File a complaint, or some equally troublesome gesture. \"You look really upset. Do you… want to talk about it?\" he asked.\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Okay. Of course, that's fine. Give you a hug, at least?\" he offered.\n\nI nodded, and he hugged me. I had only nodded reluctantly. I had thought, I really did not want anyone to touch me after that whole incident, the idea of a man touching me just made me uncomfortable to think of. Yet when he put his arms around me, despite that thought, I ended up gripping him very, very tightly, and held on for far longer than is considered normal. I realized it wasn't the same thing at all, my reluctance was unfounded. Being held like that could not have been any more different. I am not really certain as to how to describe it, so all I can say is that it made me feel safe. I felt a sense of longing to just stay like that forever.\n\n\"I'll make dinner for you, sweetie,\" he offered. \"How about soft tofu stew, extra spicy, just for you? That'll make you feel better.\" I doubted that any food would have that power, but offering to make my favourite for me was a very sweet gesture. I'm glad he's here.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\n\n\"Just sit back and relax, okay? I'll have some tea for you in a moment,\" he told me.\n\nAs it turned out, dinner was lovely and did raise my mood. The thought of {a=Han}Han{/a} touching me kept coming back to me, as I suspect it will for a long time, but then being able to look at my caring husband comes as a source of great comfort.\n\nAfter dinner, {a=Han}Mr Han{/a} finally responded to my message.\n\nHe was threatening in tone in his response, and implied both that I made the first move with him and that he could use that as blackmail material with my husband if he so wished, but ultimately agreed to the terms I laid out. I sent a short, one word response: \"okay.\" The suggestions he made were frustrating, and it makes me wish I could respond harshly to him, tell him how wrong and bad he's being, but engaging with him more won't make anything better. I just want to forget about the whole thing. Fighting would be counterproductive to that goal, not to mention massively wasting of time when I am already overburdened at work. So I sent that message, and instead put down all my feelings here, where nobody else will see.\n\nAnd now I will wash the dishes with {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a}, because I am tired of dwelling on this."

Floors probably need to be swept at some point this week. I'll do it when I'm less annoyed.\n\nIn the past month, in addition to the research work that is in my actual job description, I have organized three successful maintenance projects, compiled over a dozen sets of minutes, and learned a recently-resigned secretary's filing system in order to explain to a coworker. To say nothing of the many smaller contributions I have been asked to make, all of which unrelated to my research. This is the hardest I have worked in my life, and I am proud of what I have done.\n\nDespite this, today I had to take a pay cut. When I was called into the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a}'s office I expected the opposite. A commendation for exemplary work would have been warranted. Some manner of praise. (Given the current economic circumstances, a promotion would have been unlikely. Regardless of the fact that it is very much due.) Instead, my hourly pay will be reduced by 10%, effective immediately.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's nothing personal,\" he told me. \"Just between you and me, I've been really impressed by your work. I appreciate it and all. I'm afraid it's just a matter of department-wide policy; we've been asked to cut costs on all high-risk employees and put them towards training costs. I'm sure you understand.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I do not understand. Elaborate. In what manner am I 'high-risk?'\"\n\n\"It means at risk of quitting. I mean, really… it's because you've got more options now, we have to compensate for that somehow. Lately, because of the whole motherhood credit thing, we've been losing a lot of highly-qualified women… I mean, I'm sure you understand,\" he said. I didn't. \"If you decide to quit and have children, it's going to be expensive to train a replacement. Especially one as qualified as you!\"\n\n\"I have no intention of having children at 24,\" I told him. \"Or at any other point in the foreseeable future. The concern is unwarranted.\"\n\n\"Well… statistically speaking, as a married woman, you are. Personally, I believe you, because I know you well! I'm sure you're not lying. But I can't make an exception for anyone who says that—if I did, anyone could say that, and we'd still have a huge problem.\"\n\nI was unable to think of anything appropriate to say. I found the suggestion upsetting.\n\n\"I mean, you can see the logic in that, right? I can show you the actuarial reports if you'd like,\" he offered.\n\n\"Please do that,\" I said. After I returned home from work I had a chance to review them, and unsurprisingly, they are consistent with what he had said. I could find no grounds under which to criticize their numbers. It seemed to be based on solid research.\n\n\"But if you think it all checks out… you'll understand that it's fair, right? That's just how it goes, statistically speaking,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't argue with the logic,\" I finally admitted. I hoped that when I got home, the reports would be problematic and I could criticize them.\n\n\"I knew you'd be rational about it,\" he told me. \"That's why I'm glad you're still with us; you're definitely a logic-minded person, you understand how statistics work. And really, given how hard you work… I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't just a temporary loss. You're well on the way for a promotion.\"\n\nI was uncertain as to how to argue with that, too. I was intended to take it as a compliment and so it seemed like the only thing to do. He was right, of course. I could see the logic and I am unable to argue with it. Seeing the logic has yet to have any mitigating effect on my annoyance at the matter, however."

Dishes need to be washed, and broken mixing bowl needs replacing. Floor needs to be swept.\n\nIn retrospect I suppose it was an inevitability. For the last month I was the only woman in the department still left, excluding custodial services and the like. Certainly the last with any sort of engineering qualifications at all. Most quit. My mother tells me that all of them are pregnant now. I didn't realize my position might be in peril; I assumed I would continue to work in engineering forever, even given the pay cuts. Considering the possibility that I am actually a naïve idiot.\n\nYesterday I delivered my report on The Radiation Problem to the {a=ResearchChief}Research Chief{/a}. The entire presentation took an hour, covering most of the material in the 100 page report, and he seemed to find my conclusions both reasonable and useful. At least, he said as much. And he was taking notes the whole time. He seemed satisfied that I had proven the hypothesis, that increased levels of ambient radiation had a negative impact on fertility rates. \"I would like to extend this research further,\" I told him. \"I have reason to believe that not only could it hypothetically have an impact, but that the low birth rates on the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} are related to ambient radiation being outside safe levels. I think understanding this could be the first step in addressing a serious problem.\"\n\n\"Well, hold off on the proposal for now, but I'll think about it. That's an interesting theory. I don't know if there's really room for funding that, but I do see the importance,\" he said to me.\n\nI do not understand why he did, because near the end of the day, I got the message from him saying that I was fired effective the end of tomorrow. I feel as though I should have seen it coming. I suppose the friendliness was cowardice and an unwillingness to deliver the message to my face. I feel betrayed by his actions.\n\nWhile I was sitting there, stunned, {a=Han}Han{/a} walked into my office. I glared at him. He told me that my replacement had yet to be decided and that he wanted me to put his name in as the most qualified. I glared at him more, speechless that he would suggest such a thing.\n\n\"If you don't, I'll tell {a=Naemun}your husband{/a} that you—\" and then he made a vulgar hand gesture towards his mouth. I was sickened. I was angry. My boss treating me as though I had no value was bad enough, but to be blackmailed by someone like {a=Han}Han{/a} was beyond reproach. I am still angry thinking about it, actually. I wanted to tell him to leave me alone, that I never would. What I really wanted to say was \"fuck off!\" I tried. I was unable to work up the nerve. All I could do was log off my workstation for the last time, and watch the image of {a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a} on the desk fade away. I did not want him to see it. I tried to storm out of the office, but he grabbed me by the arm. He said that he meant what he said in a threatening tone.\n\nI didn't care anymore.\n\n\"Do what you will,\" I choked out, and yanked my arm away. I hurried out, not caring what people thought as I left the department looking upset. His threats were disgusting but at that moment I felt like they held no power. I had already lost my job, the most important thing to me. If I have no purpose, it is hard to be afraid.\n\nI feel stupid and naïve for not realizing. The timing could not have been a coincidence, being fired right after delivering my last report. Maybe I should have held on to the report, stalled. Maybe I should have known how precarious my position was. I am an idiot.\n\nLate evening addendum to this diary entry:\n\n{a=Naemun}My husband{/a} was very nice and supportive when I delivered the news to him. \"I have one more day, but I do not think I'll go in,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, hell no, of course not! Those bastards don't deserve that,\" he said, putting his hand on my shoulder. \"You're so tense. I mean, of course you are, I'm sorry, dear… turn a bit? I'll give you a massage.\" I obliged, and he started to rub my shoulders.\n\n\"Ah,\" I said. It felt nice. \"Thank you.\" I didn't know what else to say.\n\n\"Can you ask your family for help? Maybe there's something they can do about your bo— your {a=ResearchChief}old boss{/a}, I mean,\" he suggested. He was trying to be helpful, but it unfortunately was not.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's wanted to throw around much influence since the family lost the councillorship. There's complicated politics involved. I don't understand them, really,\" I told him. \"I'll ask my dad, but I am very confident that it won't help.\"\n\n\"That sucks,\" he said bluntly. I agreed with the assessment.\n\n\"I do not know what I'm going to do with my life now,\" I sighed and admitted. \"That job was everything, and I am hardly qualified to do anything else. Everyone else is settling down and having kids, but…\" I trailed off. I did not want to offend him by suggesting I did not want to have kids with him. Which is not to say that I do, but I am young, and I am sure I'll change my mind in the future. Most people seem to, and I would not assume I am any different. But right now I cannot imagine it.\n\nThankfully, he understood.\n\n\"No, no, of course not, honey, there's no rush,\" he said, hugging me tightly. \"Only when you're ready. What do you want to do now, dear? I mean, if you didn't have to worry about jobs or money or anything, what would you be doing?\"\n\n\"Well... my research is very important. I do not believe anybody else will conduct it, and I think the continued existence of {i}Mugunghwa{/i} society depends on dealing with the problem. But right now it's not even accepted that there is one,\" I said. \"I would continue working on it regardless. It is that important.\"\n\n\"Then you should keep doing it, if it's that important to you. You're a tough girl, I believe in you,\" he said to me. It means a lot to me that he says those things.\n\nI turned around, sat on his lap, and hugged him. \"Thank you for saying that. I do not know what I would do without you.\" He kissed me on the forehead, a gesture that I appreciated a great deal. \"You're right. I am tough. It's important work. I have to keep at it even without an official budget. The future of the ship is at stake.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe in you, sweetie,\" he said.\n\nI truly do not know what I would do without that man in my life. He does not really understand the importance of what I was talking about, I know. I have tried to explain without any success. But he is very kind and supports me regardless, and I have come to realize that is more important. If I was still single, alone, when I received news I was fired, I do not know what I would do. I would still be alone in my room, crying helplessly, I have no doubt. I would have no determination. It is only because of his words that I am convinced that I must persevere.\n\nYes, dear, I mean it. Even if I don't like you reading over my shoulder while I'm writing (he is doing this right now), I will certainly acknowledge that you are the greatest thing in my life, and that I am very happy to have married you. Oh, certainly. Feel free to squeeze me tighter. But right now I am going to start transferring documents from work, such that I can start planning to continue my research on The Radiation Problem from home.\n\nI feel freshly inspired. I may be a naïve idiot, but I am determined, and I have confidence that I will be able to prove my case."
    tl_hateplus_message "6-5-F" "japanese" "Worthless as a wife" "{a=Naemun}Pyeon Nae-mun{/a}" "December 16, 4044" "kr" "Dear brother,\n\nHow are you? Keeping busy, I hope? You said I could always write you for advice, no matter how weird it was, so… well, I'm calling you on that. It's about {a=Soyi}my wife{/a}. I don't know what the hell is up with her, and, well, you've met her, you know how quiet she is, it's impossible to get her to actually tell me what's wrong. I'm really worried about her and I don't know what to do.\n\nHere's some backstory: you know her, she's always been weird and introverted. It's charming, most of the time. Ever since she lost her job, though, it's been dialed up to 11. I encouraged her to take up this science project of hers right after because I figured she needed something to ease the transition, but… it's been over a year now! I thought she would've found another job outside of engineering, or better yet, decide she's ready to have kids. (Not just because of the motherhood credit, but given the extra hours I'm pulling to compensate, we sure could use it.) I mean, it's not like I didn't know what I was getting into, marrying a girl 15 years younger than me. But the obsession can't be healthy.\n\nWhat happened a couple days ago really freaked me out, and still does. I get home at 9, as usual, expecting to see her working on whatever it is that she's working on, or watching a drama, or something. Instead she's in the kitchen, on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor violently. And, I mean, our kitchen really is a mess. Everything in the apartment is a mess. I'd clean it myself if I wasn't so dead exhausted after 12-hour work days. It looked like she had put in a serious effort into cleaning up, which seemed good, except actually looking at her, she really didn't look okay at all.\n\nThen she looks up at me, and suddenly starts to cry. \"Be honest me with me. I'm worthless, aren't I?\" she asks me, totally out of nowhere. What the hell do you say to that?\n\n\"Of course not!\" I told her as immediately as I could. If she heard me, she didn't show any sign of it.\n\n\"I know I'm worthless as an engineer, or I would not have been fired. I'm worthless as a scientist, or my work would receive attention from people,\" she whimpered. \"I'm worthless as a wife, too, aren't I?\"\n\n\"You're not, sweetie,\" I told her. I got her to get up and sit on the couch with me, because discussing things with her on the floor would just be impossible. I tried doing the usual thing, where I hug her and rub her shoulders, but it didn't seem to help this time. Neither did arguing with her.\n\n\"Our apartment is a disaster. If I were better, it'd be clean, wouldn't it? You are surely disappointed about that,\" she said.\n\n\"You've been busy,\" I told her. I don't really understand why she hasn't been able to find the time, but I could hardly say \"yes\", could I?\n\n\"We never eat together, either. We rarely talk. This is the most we've said to each other all month. It's my fault,\" she said.\n\nDo you have any idea what to say to that? I have no idea how you're supposed to reassure women when they're telling the truth like that. I mean, I knew I couldn't agree, but all I could think to say was \"No, it's not,\" which is pretty lame.\n\n\"How long prior was the last time we even had sex? I'm worthless that way, too,\" she said.\n\n\"Well… something's been on your mind the last few times we tried. It's okay, there's no pressure. Besides, it's not like we're newlyweds.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter! That's no excuse…\" she said. \"Or have you just given up on me? You have given up on me, haven't you?\"\n\n\"I—\" I tried to say something, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I really am worthless!\" she cried. \"And now I am merely wasting your time with whining, aren't I?\"\n\n\"You're not worthless. And you can always talk to me. That's what I'm here for,\" I responded. It sounded pathetic the moment I said it.\n\n\"What if I started cooking dinner for you? If I am spending all my time at home, I merely… should be carrying my own weight,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't know how to cook, sweetie. And that's fine.\"\n\n\"I truly am worthless!\" she said loudly, and started to cry again.\n\nI was at a loss, and frankly, I'm still not sure if what I said was the right thing. It sounded idiotic at the time and it sounds that way now, even though it got her to stop crying. If you know what I should've said, though, I'm all ears.\n\n\"You can help out more with the cleaning, if you want, though. It would be nice. It looks like you've already done a lot of hard work, and I really appreciate that, dear. And if you want to… er, you know… I'm not going to complain,\" I stumbled over my words like an idiot. An idiot whose idea of comforting {a=Soyi}his wife{/a} is telling her to clean up and have sex with him. What the hell. Even if it did get her to stop crying. I don't know, I'm bad with women. Clearly.\n\n\"I can do that! I'd like to! It would make me feel less worthless,\" she said. \"And besides, I'm your wife.\"\n\nThen she wiped her tears from her eyes, and gave me a really intense look. \"Do… you want to?\" she asked. I'm not a young man anymore, it's not like that's really something I had in mind, especially seeing her like that, but how could I say no?\n\nShe kissed me, and I got into it soon enough. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if I dislike kissing my cute 20-something wife and her soft lips. It's just the circumstances, you know? Sex is supposed to be all about connecting people, but it just made me think that I don't really get her. I have no idea what had triggered this. It's really hard not to think about what's going on in her head while she was doing that, and hell if I know.\n\nMaybe it's not so bad, though. It felt like she had passion again, at least. I guess it's because she felt like she had to overcompensate, but she took the lead, guiding my hand up her skirt. At the risk of being too graphic, she held my hand while I played with her, and kissed me gently. It seemed very sweet of her.\n\nAfter that, she went down on me. I didn't really think anything about it while she was doing it, for obvious reasons, but after she was done, she sat on my lap and held my wrist tightly. And it occurred to me that this was the first time she'd given head in years. I really hope it wasn't for my sake. I don't know. Her eyes were still watering at that point, but she also refused to let go. I don't know what the hell to make of that.\n\nIt's been a couple days and now the apartment is pretty much all clean. She took it really seriously, I guess. I'm still really worried about her. Even after that, we haven't communicated any better. If she feels worthless, is a clean apartment really going to make her feel like she has value again? I mean, I know she does, I just don't know how to convince her of it.\n\n…on the other hand, I just realized the one thing right now that I didn't say to her. And I should go do that. So never mind, I guess, I don't need to send this letter after all. Which is good, because it'd make the next family gathering weird if talking to {a=Soyi}my wife{/a} just made you think of your old brother's manhood. That would be gross. I mean, I sure don't want to think about yours, either.\n\nAnyway, now I'm going to go tell her what she really needs to hear: that she should keep on doing her science thing, whatever the hell it is. That's probably the thing that'll make her feel like she's not worthless. If she believes it's important, that's what she should dedicate herself to doing. That's less awkward and weird than household cleaning and sex, at least. I'll tell her that I'll keep supporting her in her struggle with that. I think that's what she was looking for this whole time.\n\nI'm glad I realized that.\n\nLove, (even though I'm not sending this,)\n{a=Naemun}Nae-mun{/a}"

The ship sailed on getting that one right a long time ago.]\n\nApartment status: bed is made. A few dishes need to be washed. Take-out containers need to be taken to garbage. Floor is clean.\n\nAfter two years without any sort of breakthrough, and dozens of appeals without any form of acknowledgement, I believe I have discovered the evidence that I need to provide definitive proof.\n\nThere has always been a bizarre family legend of an eccentric-but-brilliant ancient Earthborn ancestor who saved his terminally ill daughter through unconventional methods. In some tellings, she is a ghost that lives in the computer. In others, she is sealed away in an \"alternate dimension,\" to return when the ship has landed on a planet with fresh air.\n\nI learned the truth from {a=Grandmother}my grandmother{/a} at the New Year's gathering. In reality, she does exist, and is merely in cryonic sleep in the family's storage closet. I caught a glimpse of her at that gathering, and realized that she was the key to proving my thesis. Today, I returned with {a=Naemun}my husband{/a} to their home, having offered her a great-grandchildren-related bribe in order to have access to the sleeping {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a} to run tests.\n\nMy theory is: as she has not consumed food or water, or breathed air, in nearly 1600 years, if there has been a significant increase in ambient radiation in that duration, she should be significantly less affected by it. Her chamber was sealed partially by glass, so she may not be completely unaffected, but I anticipate that the difference will be readily observable. The technology involved in her preservation seems extraordinarily designed. I can believe that it came from the same level of Earthborn brilliance that built our ship.\n\nWhile {a=Naemun}my husband{/a} was gracefully distracting my grandparents by listening to their stories, I set up in the storage closet, attempting to open the capsule labelled \"{a=Hyunae}Kim Hyun-ae, Pale Bride{/a}.\"\n\nThis action was easier said than done. A separate, hacked-together computer was regulating the capsule, but the labeled switch for opening it was non-operational. It took a significant while to figure out that I needed to connect a secondary battery, and insert an override key, to enable the switch. It did not help that I was very trepidatious to fiddle with Earthborn-designed technology that was completely over my head. Accidentally causing damage with my clumsiness would have been disastrous.\n\nThe warm-up cycle took a good ten minutes. As I watched her, I became very aware of the fact that she was a real girl. A very old one. An orphan who lost her family centuries ago, who likely had her own hopes and dreams. I found myself hoping that one day we would find a way to let her live the rest of her life, although given the state of modern medicine, optimism would be sadly unfounded.\n\nEven after she was brought back to life by the machine, she did not actually awaken, going from a near-dead state to merely sleeping. She looked very peaceful. I tried not to disturb her too badly when I took a small sample of her blood. Still, she started to open her eyes, mumbling quietly.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Go back to sleep, little one,\" I said, touching her face gently. \"It's not time to wake up yet.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" she murmured, and she closed her eyes again.\n\nI suddenly felt guilty, and quickly put her back into the freeze where she belonged. It is justifiable, of course. She remains unharmed, and will continue to rest peacefully. I doubt she will think of it as anything more than a brief dream. And regardless of any discomfort I caused that poor child, proving my hypothesis may be necessary for ensuring that society thrives until the future where she might awaken.\n\nAfterwards I rescued {a=Naemun}my brave husband{/a} and let my grandparents pester me about our family plans instead. I did not mind talking to them, and they discussed things more freely than the usual tone at large family gatherings. I was very alarmed to discover just how badly even the main branch had been doing over the past couple years. Losing the councillorship and therefore nobility status has had a great impact on everyone, not just me, although I still feel my situation is worse.\n\nHopefully, however, that situation will only be temporary. If the data received from analyzing the {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a}'s blood sample supports my theory, and I am confident it will, it should give it enough strength that I will be taken seriously again. Things may not improve in the short term. But they will, eventually. Of this I have confidence."

If only we had swallowed our pride sooner, but instead my sister beat me to it, so now I am stuck living with my in-laws in their garishly decorated home.\n\nI do not wish to mention it to {a=Naemun}my husband{/a}, because I appreciate the economic circumstances that necessitated our move and do not wish to seem ungrateful for the support they are providing by renting us the space, but I do not like my in-laws at all. My mother- and father-in-law are old enough to be my grandparents, which is fine, however I find them to not be friendly. They are not rude, they simply do not speak to me, ever. My brother-in-law seems friendly, and very spirited, but to me he never says anything and immediately excuses himself from any conversation I attempt to start.\n\nI believe they are afraid of me. I do not understand why, and I wish I knew what it was that I have done to inspire such feelings in them. I find it very hurtful to be surrounded by people but have them willfully ignore me for reasons unknown. I stay in the bedroom as much as possible as a result. We have a computer screen next to our bed, anyway, so it is sufficient for me to work from. If I bury myself in work, I can ignore those feelings.\n\nThankfully, work continues at a good pace again. It took much longer than anticipated, but I was finally able to use my old professor's equipment at Mugunghwa University to perform tests on the {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a}'s blood. The results are unsurprising and the proof is unequivocal. Ambient radiation on the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} truly is much higher than the standard baseline. The current levels are not normal, and with minimal massaging of the data, a linear direct correlation with birth rates and ambient radiation extrapolated from current levels and the {a=Hyunae}Pale Bride{/a}'s blood can be demonstrated.\n\nThere is no doubt: our society is being killed slowly by infertility caused by increased radiation levels. When my report is complete, I will certainly be able to present it, and I have no doubt it will be taken seriously. I merely have to get through this, finish all this work, and finally I will be able to get my life back on track."

Things have been strained with us as of late. We have never been able to communicate under the best of circumstances, but even more now, I feel as though there is a wedge between us. When I told him about having a chance to prove myself, and how I was looking forward to the future, he just seemed upset. I wanted him to be proud of me for making it this far, despite all the difficulties. I wanted him to be as supportive of me as he was from the start.\n\n\"I want to feel like I'm not doing this alone,\" I pleaded with him as we got ready for bed.\n\n\"What are you going to do if they ignore you after all that? What if they don't go through with what you want? What then?\" he asked me. He seemed disappointed. \"Have you even considered that possibility?\"\n\n\"It's unlikely. The data is irrefutable, and easy to understand. Radiation is unquestionably the cause of decreased fertility on the {i}Mugunghwa{/i},\" I told him. \"I have confidence that no reasonable person could disregard my report.\"\n\n\"Fine! I'm sure it is, I just…\" he trailed off. \"I don't care. I'm going to bed now.\" He turned his back on me.\n\n\"Wait!\" I said, hurrying over to sit in front of him. \"What if I did make plans for the extremely unlikely event that things do not work out? Would that make you happy?\"\n\n\"Forget it!\" he said, annoyed.\n\n\"I mean it,\" I said. \"I do not want to be the cause of you being upset. I want things to be amicable between us again. I am willing to make contingencies for things that I do not believe will occur if it is something that will make you happy.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the hell that means. You're doing that thing where you talk over my head, and I hate that,\" he scowled.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"If you want me to consider that things might not work out, I will consider it. Let's consider it. I don't think it'll happen. But there is no harm in considering it.\"\n\n\"What's the point? I'm sure you'll find some smart-talking way around it in the end, anyway, so you can just go back your self-obsessed science project shit in the end. You always do,\" he said angrily.\n\n\"Please don't say that!\" I said, my voice quavering. \"You're my husband! I love you more than anything. Please, don't you stop taking me seriously, too!\"\n\nHe looked away, and there was a long pause. I felt like crying, when just minutes before I was so happy. Eventually, he made eye contact with me. He seemed to be confused.\n\n\"…sorry,\" he said in a sheepish manner. \"Do you really mean that? You love me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" I stated.\n\n\"…you've never said that to me before,\" he said. I was skeptical.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm absolutely positive,\" he told me. I was sure he was wrong, but as he had just apologized to me, I saw no reason to worsen things by arguing.\n\n\"Well, I do,\" I said. \"I love you very much.\"\n\n\"Come here, you,\" he said, grabbing me, pulling me onto his lap, just like the old days. He hugged me, and I was unable to stop myself from crying at that moment. \"What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" I told him.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said.\n\n\"Let's make fallback plans,\" I said. \"In case I am unable to convince them, what would you like?\"\n\nHe was quiet for a moment. \"I want to have kids,\" he said. \"Not just because it would help with the money. I just want to have kids. I want to have a girl. An adorable little girl, who will be smart and pretty and dedicated, just like her mother. After that, maybe we can have a couple of boys. She'll have to learn to keep them in line, but I can teach her that. And you can teach her science.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I said.\n\n\"You promise?\" he asked. \"After all this is done, if your presentation doesn't lead to a job, you promise me you'll settle down and we'll try to have kids?\"\n\n\"I can make no promises with regards to gender. But I promise, if my presentation is unsuccessful, I will give up, and we will try to have kids,\" I said.\n\nIt seemed to comfort him a great deal. I felt guilty, and hoped that he did not have his hopes up. It is unlikely that the report will be ignored, so I will not be following through on that promise. In the future, maybe we will anyway, but it was a promise that would not lead to anything, because I am certain that I will be very busy with work in the future. I hope it does not disappoint him.\n\nI am happy now, though, and I am optimistic for the future. I have an audience that will lead to something being done about our society's greatest problem, and with the irrefutable and extensive proof I have compiled, I will be taken seriously again. In just a matter of days, I will be on track again.\n\nI am also happy because after I promised that, he took me by the chin, smiled, and said to me: \"I'm going to hold you to that. I'm also going to kiss you now.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I'd like that,\" I told him. When he did, I had never felt such relief in my life. I had my husband caring about me again, and I had a future. I had value and a purpose, and finally, it will not just be me repeating these things to myself. I have persevered for so long, and soon it will pay off, in just a matter of days. \n\nI also enjoyed the kiss aside from its symbolic meaning. It simply felt very nice. I could have melted in his arms right there.\n\nI am certain of it: everything will be alright."

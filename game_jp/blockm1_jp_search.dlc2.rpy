    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-B" "japanese_for_search" "ろーせずさとられず" "すみす" "4038ねん9つき16にち" "kr" "{a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} has once again tried my patience by requesting a meeting with me and {a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a} at a very specific time and location, then showing up late! The subject was so important, I had no choice to put up with it, but it doesn't mean I appreciate the utter lack of respect. She insisted on meeting in the upper plaza restaurant Royal, and her lieutenant {a=Seoyeong}Heo{/a} was the first there, but it took {a=OldMute}the Councillor{/a} herself a whole half an hour for her to finally show up on our private room's screen.\n\n\"Hey! Sorry I'm late!\" she announced in the same perfect gratingly cheerful voice she's had for the past fifty years. \"You didn't start eating without me, did you?\"\n\nHow irritating.\n\n\"We'd never do that! Should I pour you a glass of wine?\" asked {a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a} cloyingly, raising the pitcher in her direction. He's always been like this with her, ever since he inherited his council position. I can never tell if he understands the implications of her being an immortal computer program, or if he's just an idiot. Probably he's just an idiot.\n\n\"Ha ha, man, I wish. With the sort of shit we've got to deal with, I sure could use it,\" she said, with a slight flip of her golden hair. Then she turned to me. \"Anyway… {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a}, I bet you're wondering why I asked you here, right?\"\n\n\"You said it was important,\" I said, impatiently.\n\n\"It's about the Committee for Freer Democracy,\" she said, with appropriate scorn emphasizing their name. \"This week, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a} has literally done nothing but shut down their meetings. How many noise violation orders have you issued in the past seven days? Ten?\"\n\n\"Fifteen,\" said {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a}. It was a dramatic tactic on {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}'s part; as if she didn't know exactly how many.\n\n\"My bad,\" she said. \"And every week, the number of private log entries using their keywords doubles. I'm worried we're going to be reaching a critical mass soon. At this rate, I'm worried that the Presidential election results are going to lead to, like, public demonstrations. We can't deal with that.\"\n\n\"You're the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, it's your damned job to deal with it,\" I told her. \"I'm not interested in excuses.\"\n\n\"She's not making excu—\" {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a} started, out of line, but {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} managed to muzzle her.\n\n\"Stand down, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a},\" she told her. But then she turned to me with the same rudeness: \"Now listen here, young man. I was not, like, asking your approval. We have a problem, and a stern lecture from the {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a} is not going to help. Okay? You can blame me if you want, but that's not going to solve shit.\"\n\n{a=Yang}Yang{/a} stifled a grin, thinking that I wasn't looking; I had to glare to put him back in line. Sheepishly, he took a large drink of his wine.\n\n\"I'd at least like to know why it is that you can't even do your job effectively,\" I demanded. \"At least show some respect.\"\n\n\"Okay, uh, sure. You got it, {i}sir,{/i}\" she said sarcastically, an impossible expression on her face. \"But I think, {i}sir{/i}, you misunderstand what my job is. My job isn't to stop public demonstrations. My job is to make sure public demonstrations don't happen in the first place. Like, do you have any idea what happened the last time we had public demonstrations?\"\n\nShe paused. She expected me to actually answer her question, prepared to pounce the moment I got even the slightest detail wrong. I tried to recall, but she said something before I had the chance to say anything.\n\n\"No, of course you don't, it was like four centuries ago. They led to open, armed rebellion. We're talking about outright banditry, okay? This is not tenable. {i}Sir,{/i}\" she said, in a high-and-mighty way. \"Do you have any idea what martial law is like? 'cause that's what it took to crush it last time.\"\n\n\"So,\" interrupted {a=Yang}Yang{/a}, \"you're saying that carrying out your job needs our help.\"\n\n\"You got it, {a=Yang}Councillor{/a},\" she said. \"Look, there's no need for hostilities, men. We've got a common problem here, and I think we can sort it out. And really, {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a}… in my opinion, as {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, and as the eldest person around by like a millennium, I think we can sort this out. But I wouldn't have asked you here if I didn't need your help.\"\n\nI sighed. She had a point. If I had to clean up what she couldn't, that's her job. \"What's your plan?\"\n\n\"You're not going to like it,\" she said, and I was sure I believed her. \"First, we let {a=Park}Park{/a} back in the Presidential race. That's what the agitators have been getting upset about it, so it'd take the wind right out of their sails if we take away their main point of contention.\"\n\n\"That's madness! He's a radical, and he'd very likely be elected!\" I said.\n\n\"What's the worst that happens? We just veto the bastard down at every step. The President's powerless against the Council in the end,\" {a=Yang}Yang{/a} suggested.\n\n\"No, no. No good. I mean, you're right, but that'll just lead to more unrest,\" she said, shaking her head.\n\n\"What the hell do you propose, then? Just let him dictate his crazy radical anti-noble policies?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Yeah. Actually. I think that's our best shot. Hear me out, okay? You resign as Chief Councillor—and don't give me shit, here, I know you've been meaning to for ages, don't pretend like you'd be upset for that to happen. We put in someone new, younger, as the face of the Council. Say it's part of our new direction. The President's going to call for reforms, and we're going to let him, and our new direction will be going along with them.\"\n\n\"So we just yield to the madness of democracy, then?\" I said incredulously. She sounded absolutely insane. But of course, she had a plan, I'm pained to admit.\n\n\"No, that's crazy, of course not,\" she said, and then she grinned madly. \"We pretend to. We're going to be the democracy movement's worst friend. If the President proposes reforms, yeah, we'll nod along, we'll say we'll do it… then we'll water it down. We'll stall. 'cause, like, here's the thing: the people, they don't have specific demands. They're dumb, they're okay with compromises. All we have to do is make it look like they've won, and the movement loses all its momentum.\"\n\n\"And then… rebellion crushed!\" said {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a}, smashing her fist into her palm dramatically. \"Efficiently, and subtly.\"\n\n\"You got it. Efficient and subtle. That's how we do it,\" said {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}.\n\nI wasn't sure at first what I thought of her plan. It's insane, for sure. It's incredibly bold. But the more I thought about it over dinner, I thought, maybe that's what we need. In all the time I've known {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, she might try my patience, but I've never known her intentions to be misplaced. She might be chatty, and a gossip, and disrespectful, but one thing is for sure: she's honest, and never manipulative. I think there's a reason why she came to my face and asked me this, when she could have just gone around me with the rest of the Council. She might be a bitch at times, but she's still programmed to always act in the best interests of the ship's safety. Always.\n\nBy the time we'd finished eating, I'd just about made up my mind.\n\n\"Who do you propose as the new face of the Council, then? You?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ha ha, oh, please.\" She shook her head dramatically. \"I said a younger face! Mine's as old as it gets.\"\n\n\"Only by choice,\" {a=Yang}Yang{/a} said. \"You can always look as young and beautiful as you'd like.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. I've done that before, and when the fashions change, I'm sure I'll do it again,\" she started.\n\n\"I think you look fine the way you are, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a},\" said {a=Seoyeong}Heo{/a}, an odd tone to her voice.\n\n\"It's not the point, okay?\" She shook her head, looking exacerbated. \"We need someone who's actually young, who the peasantry will trust as a being willing to accept new ideas.\"\n\n\"{a=Lee}Councillor Lee{/a}, perhaps,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Ah, no, definitely not. Too charismatic, too ambitious. That woman has got an agenda, and I do not trust it for a second,\" she said. She was probably right, on reflection. \"{a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a}, who would you suggest?\"\n\nHe paused. Then a flash of light seemed to go off behind his dim eyes.\n\n\"{a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu Hyeon-su{/a},\" he said. \"Give it to the useless figurehead {a=Ryu}Councillor of Captaincy{/a}. He'll be so thrilled to actually have a real job, he'd never think to do anything with it.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said too, after a pause of reflection. \"He's young, completely malleable, but plausible as a reformer. As the face of impotent rebellion… {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} would be perfect.\"\n\nThat was where we left the discussion for that night. And now, I guess it's time to tell my wife that I'll finally be retiring. She'll be thrilled."
    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-C" "japanese_for_search" "せんきょびのよる" "ほ・すんぼく" "4038ねん11つき29にち" "kr" "Man, I had the weirdest fucking night.\n\nDespite half the security force being pulled in to guard polling stations on election night, I was off duty at the time, watching dramas with my similarly off duty {a=SeungboksFather}father{/a}. (I'm not a fan, but he is. I find them pretty unbelievable, honestly.) Anyway, he got the idea from one of the episodes that now would be the perfect time to send a gift to {a=Seoyeong}Chief Security Officer Heo{/a}, my aunt in the main branch, to say thanks for giving us the worst night off. Not that he actually had anything suitable, of course. He spent like ten minutes scrounging and was only able to find a moderately expensive-looking wine bottle we'd been ignoring for years. He seemed to think it made perfect sense. Well, whatever, that's dad-logic, I guess.\n\nSo I took it down the corridor to the main branch family's home. {a=SeungboksFather}My father{/a} suggested it'd be a quick five minute in-and-out affair, but it took five minutes at the doorbell just to get any sort of response. Whatever, it's not like I had anything better to do. A cute maid answered the door. She looked pretty sheepish.\n\n\"Can I see {a=Seoyeong}Chief Heo{/a} briefly?\" I asked her. \"If it isn't trouble.\"\n\n\"Sorry… she's out right now,\" she said quietly, still halfway behind the door.\n\n\"Is {a=Kim}her husband{/a} home, then? I have something to drop off,\" I said.\n\n\"He's home, but… uh…\" She suddenly blushed, and looked away. \"{a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} is… he's busy right now, and not to be interrupted. Sorry…\"\n\n\"I just have something to drop off, it'd only take a minute,\" I said.\n\n\"I… really couldn't interrupt. {i}Busy,{/i}\" she said awkwardly, looking down and scratching her neck. It'd taken me a sec to catch her meaning.\n\n\"And {a=Seoyeong}Chief Heo{/a} is at the office?\" I asked.\n\n\"…yes,\" she said quietly. \"Sorry, I have to go now…\" And then she closed the door on me without another word.\n\nIt was pretty fucking awkward, but whatever, I figured I might as well go try to deliver it to her office. I figured I should at least be able to say that I tried in good faith and all. And man, good thing I did, too.\n\nPretty much all the desks in the main security office were empty, although all the lamps were still lit. Apparently I interrupted her in the middle of a conversation with {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} herself.\n\n\"Yes, mister? Can I help you?\" she said to me.\n\nI introduced myself as {a=SeungboksFather}her brother{/a}'s son. It probably could have gone better. \"He wanted to send you a gift. As a thanks for working so diligently on the hardest night.\" Or something like that. Maybe with more stammering.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"it most certainly is the most difficult night.\"\n\nAt that point, as if on cue, she got distracted by a message in her earpiece.\n\n\"Oh, don't say that,\" she replied to the voice in her ear. \"Are you serious? Are these reliable reports?\" After a pause, she filled a shot glass with something from her shelf, and slammed it back. \"I will kill them,\" she said. \"If you see anyone carrying anything that even looks like political signs, I want them set on fire. Not the signs, the men. Actually, the signs too. The point is, I want them dead!\" she shouted.\n\nAt that point, I was ready to leave, and just waiting for a pause so I could excuse myself.\n\n\"Okay, belay that,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said from the nearby screen, pantomiming an earpiece of her own. \"Lieutenant, do not murder anyone. Elections with murders in them pretty much always turn into disasters. Let's not do that, please.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine, no murders. Continue to monitor the situation,\" she said. Then she turned to {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}. \"For now, I'd recommend some unscheduled maintenance on the rail corridor the fake ballots were spotted on.\"\n\n\"Already done,\" {a=OldMute}the Councillor{/a} said. \"Can we send a team to intercept them?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said {a=Seoyeong}Heo{/a}. \"We're already spread thin as it is. If we just sent a couple uniforms in, to be blunt, I don't think they could take out the protestors efficiently. It would cause a scene.\"\n\n\"Really? You can't do better than that? I'm disappointed,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said. \"I expected better.\"\n\n\"Regardless, I don't think they could,\" she replied directly.\n\n\"Fine. Guess we'll have to avoid that. The last thing I want to hear are rumours that the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} is stifling the democratic process. That'll really agitate the damned democracy agitators,\" she said bluntly. I was surprised to hear it from the {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a} herself. I mean, not that I'd ever heard anything from her before, but it sounded surprising. \"Bunch of idiots. Don't they know that their candidate has already won? What's the point in protesting for {a=Park}Park{/a} when he already has the Presidency in the bag?\"\n\n\"Are you sure you don't want to set them on fire?\" she suggested.\n\n\"Man, knock it off. Murder is going to lead to rioting. Let's avoid that kind of shit, please,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} replied, rubbing her forehead. \"Hey, if you're spread so thin, why is he off-duty?\" she asked, glancing at me. I was way past the point of not wanting to be there.\n\n\"That's a good question. Why are you, officer?\" {a=Seoyeong}my aunt{/a} asked, staring.\n\nI stammered, \"I don't have a weapons permit yet, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, it might be prudent to get one, don't you think?\" she replied.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what I said. Something like \"yes ma'am,\" I think. But it seemed like the perfect chance to get out of there, so I excused myself and did.\n\nI'm not really sure what they were talking about, even now. I didn't hear anything about trouble with protesters, and I've definitely heard no end to family members complaining about {a=Park}Park{/a} being elected, so they were right about that. I guess they managed to sort it out, somehow.\n\nIt sure was weird, though. And I guess maybe I should try for that weapons permit?"

There's a lot more silver hair mixed in with her blonde, and she's been wearing it short. And I'm really enjoying her new suits that seem to be all about narrow waisted vests instead of jackets. It cuts a strong silhouette, and it feels really intimidating. I'm so happy to see her dress like that, when the fashion lately has been for women to wear long dresses and seem less imposing, she's really done the opposite.\n\nI think she's the most gorgeous she's ever looked, grey hair and all. I mean, I always feel outclassed by her, and I know she's got 1600 years on me, but I'm glad she's starting to look older at the same time I'm feeling it. I wonder how often she changes her visual age. Regardless, she makes it look so good.

    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-F" "japanese_for_search" "ほかのしゅーかいなんてくそくらえだ" "ほ・すんぼく" "4042ねん7つき3にち" "kr" "I am so sick of spending time with my extended family. I don't think I've ever met a single person who thinks these Heo family gatherings are any fun. Everyone I've talked to seems to secretly hate them, every single one, but we all pretend to care and take interest in how every random unimportant cousin has been doing, and who's just got married, and who fucking cares about it all.\n\nThis time someone apparently paid serious money to hire an entire troupe of actors to perform short scenes in the living room, which at least shut down the conversation. Unfortunately, the performances were complete shit. I needed to get away, and slipped out between sets under the pretense of trying to find the washroom, in the hopes of falling in and therefore having an excuse for not being around.\n\nInstead, while I was wandering the halls of the main branch's absurdly large home, I ended up stumbling on the weirdest scene: a table with a card game in-progress on it, with an {a=Kim}old professor of mine{/a} at one end, and a mostly-naked flatchested maid sitting on strewn-about clothes.\n\n\"Uh, sorry… I was, uh, looking for the washroom,\" I said sheepishly, and started to back away. It wasn't even like the door was closed, I wasn't trying to sneak in anywhere. They were just there for anyone in the hall to see.\n\n\"Wait! Don't go, cute boy!\" the maid called out. \"Do you want play hwatu? We could really use a third.\"\n\n\"Uh… is that okay?\" I asked, looking at {a=Kim}the professor{/a}, terrified that I had interrupted an intimate moment. Then I remembered the last time I'd visited their home looking for {a=Seoyeong}his wife, the Chief Security Officer{/a}, and how he was indisposed then, too. That was a weird fucking night.\n\n\"Yes, if you have silver to play for,\" he said with a shrug. It really did seem like he didn't care.\n\n\"Uh, sure,\" I said. Even then I got the feeling I was about to be hustled, but whatever. \"Anything to escape the family.\"\n\n\"I hear that,\" he said. \"Bloody in-laws.\"\n\n\"Uh, I'm a Heo too,\" I said, then I introduced myself. \"You're {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a}, right? I had you in an Earth history class.\"\n\n\"Let me guess: first year? You and every other officer in your family,\" he said. \"Go ahead and deal, {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}.\"\n\nI can't really give a play-by-play of the game itself, I don't really remember that well. It probably didn't help that after putting our silver for the stakes, {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} kept pouring me more and more to drink.\n\n\"That's a really unusual name. Is it your real one?\" I asked {a=Mimi}the maid{/a}.\n\n\"Nope!\" was the only response.\n\nI kept trying not to stare, and it wasn't working. Maybe that's what the nudity was for, to win at cards by means of seduction. I mean, man, it sure worked. It was pretty hard to not get caught up thinking about how soft that bare skin would feel against my hands and instead worry about my hand in the game.\n\nIt was also losing me a rapid number of points. At first I didn't realize just how badly I was doing, because I assumed my real threat was {a=Kim}the professor{/a}, and he always seemed to be at the same point I was. And {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} was only whittling us down very slowly, never calling \"go\" no matter how big the lead was. The next thing I knew, we were both out.\n\n\"Oh, wow, I won!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} exclaimed with a girlish giggle. \"I feel like I'm on a roll! How about another, but with higher stakes? A five-silver per point?\"\n\nAnd that was the hustle.\n\n\"No bloody way. I know when I'm done,\" {a=Kim}the professor{/a} said. \"I'm sitting this one out.\"\n\nI would be lying if I said the reason why I went in wasn't simply because I was attracted and wanted to spend more time with {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}. I mean, I figured I'd be able to make back my money, because I couldn't really take that giggling very seriously. But mostly it was attraction.\n\nIt ended pretty quickly. Three rounds in, I had arrogantly raised the stakes, then promptly got utterly swept with a single play that took my opponent from 0 points to having more than enough to wipe me out. Twice.\n\n\"Go or stop?\" I asked.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\n\"That, uh, puts me in an awkward position,\" I explained. \"If you do that, you'll win, and I'll be out, and I don't have anything more in my purse. But I'm having a lot of fun playing with you, so if you say go, we can take another few rounds.\"\n\n\"Nope. Stop!\" was the response, followed by a cutesy head tilt. Then I watched as my money got swept off the table. \"I'm not playing for fun. I'm playing for money!\"\n\n\"You're vicious,\" I teased.\n\n\"I have to be!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} exclaimed. \"I've got tutors for my entrance exams to pay for, and I am but a poor little thing!\" The last word was dragged out. It was a little bit too cutesy.\n\n\"Tutors? The exams aren't that hard,\" I said.\n\n\"Ha! And when did you take them? 4030?\" {a=Kim}the professor{/a} scoffed.\n\n\"Uh, '37. I'm not that old,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, they were a lot easier then. Anyone could get in. How many Chinese characters do you know, kid?\" he asked, rolling his eyes at me. I thought back to school. He was actually my least favourite professor. I thought he was pretty obnoxious.\n\n\"I dunno. Not many,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Yeah, right. Nowadays, you need to know a thousand in order to get in. Mind you, you'll have trouble in a lot of Classics classes if that's all you know, but it's the bare minimum,\" he told me.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, well, that's what's important nowadays,\" he said.\n\n\"How's that?\" I couldn't imagine why.\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" he said. \"I'm a History professor. It's way out of my bloody field; I don't care about Confucius. If I had it my way it'd still be like it was before.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said.\n\n\"Hence all the tutors!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, pouring me another drink. \"Hey, how about another game?\"\n\n\"I think he's had enough to drink,\" {a=Kim}the professor{/a} said. In retrospect, he was absolutely right.\n\n\"I'm fine, I can handle it,\" I said, absolutely wrong. \"I'm in security, we drink pretty fucking hard.\"\n\n\"So {a=Seoyeong}my wife{/a} keeps complaining,\" he responded. \"Fine, if we're in the 'stupid' part of the evening, I'll leave you two to it. Have fun, kids.\" He turned to look at {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}. \"I'm going to go find the maid you swindled that uniform from, since half the work's done for me. Give it back when you're done.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} responded.\n\n…oh. That completely went over my fucking head at the time, on account of the drinking. I just realized right now: the \"joke\" was that {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} had stolen the maid's clothes and their rightful owner was presumably naked somewhere. Holy fucking yikes, man. I totally did not get that at the time.\n\nAnyway, then I was alone, for which I was kinda glad, because it gave me a chance to get closer.\n\n\"So, another game?\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} asked.\n\n\"Uh… my purse is empty, I've got nothing,\" I said. \"Play just for fun?\"\n\n\"I only play for keeps. How about I loan you back the 600 silver you just lost?\" Even I could tell this was a bad idea at this point. Too bad my dick couldn't, and it was what was making decisions for me at that point. \"I'll need to take something as collateral.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, far too quickly.\n\n\"A kiss,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} responded, smiling coyly at me, a finger against the lips. I was wrapped around that finger at this point.\n\nTo make a long story short, I naturally agreed, and the kiss that was taken from me was amazing. You know, the kind that just makes you want more and more, and frustrates you. That was the point, I have no doubt. It fucking well worked. I didn't want to win back my money, that was just money. I wanted to win {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}.\n\nAnyway, I sure didn't win back the money. I was cleaned out in ten minutes.\n\n\"Well, I'm off,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, starting to pull the strewn clothes into something more proper-like.\n\n\"Wait!\" I said, not actually having a follow-through. I just stared for a moment trying to think of something. \"How am I going to pay you back?\"\n\n\"{a=Seungbok}Heo Seung-bok{/a}? I'm sure I can find you.\"\n\n\"How about I pay you with dinner sometime?\" I asked.\n\n{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} laughed. \"Cute boy, you know I'm not a girl, right?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do you think I would've let you kiss me if you were?\" I asked. I thought it was the coolest fucking line at the time. It wasn't. True, but definitely not fucking cool.\n\n\"You're funny,\" he said. \"I'll see you around.\"\n\nI sure hope so. After he left, I stumbled back out to the main party, thankfully to discover that the actors were done and that there was now food to be had. Which I sure needed. I really couldn't get that card hustling boy, and the sight of his really gorgeous body, and that kiss, out of my head. Still can't. Eventually the family members just stopped bothering me because I was pretty clearly spaced out by thinking of him.\n\nI only feel a little bit bad. If I'm going to get played, man, it could be a lot worse than by someone like that. A lot worse. Damn. I sure hope I see him again."

There goes my whole first fucking paycheque after my big promotion.\n\nTotally worth it!\n\nIt took an obnoxiously long time to actually track him down even after I worked up the guts for it. It turns out I was a lot braver with him while not sober. But even after working it up, and asking {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} to get in touch with him, I never heard a word back from that boy. After a few months, eventually I gave up.\n\nThen suddenly, near the end of my last shift of the week doing patrols of the plaza, I ran into him. Well, more like he ran into me. Knocked me RIGHT over onto my ass. I was about to curse him out, but then he offered me his hand, and I realized who it was.\n\n\"Sorry. Come on, hurry up!\" he said, helping me to my feet, then suddenly starting to run, still holding my hand. I had no choice but to follow him. I didn't want to let go and miss my chance!\n\nWe spent a good minute darting through corridors and between shops, and even took a shortcut through a tea house that was definitely the kind of shit I'd normally give someone a citation for.\n\nAnyway, eventually we stopped to catch our breath, and he explained that he was running away from a couple of men who were angry at him because he'd cleaned them out gambling.\n\nI checked the time: officially off the clock.\n\n\"Let me make it up to you, buy you dinner,\" I said, in a perfect world where I'm actually as charming as he is and don't choke on my words in front of a pretty face. I'm not even going to write down what I actually said. I'm hoping by the time I read this again, I'll have forgotten it entirely. [[EDIT: Well, that sure was wishful thinking.]\n\n\"Take me to Golden House, then,\" he said with a lilt to his voice.\n\n\"Uh, I don't think I can afford that,\" I tried to protest.\n\n\"Sure you can! And you owe me, big time,\" he said.\n\nAfter more back and forth of that, I relented. I pretty much had to.\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'll take you to Golden House. But only because it'll clear my debt,\" I said. …and because, honestly, I did want to impress him deep down. Um, I mean, deep down, I did want to impress him. The thing I wrote before sounds way more dirty than I meant. Me am no good with words.\n\nAnyways! I took him there, and while I don't really know much about western style food, it seemed pretty good to me. He just kept ordering more wine for the both of us.\n\n\"That's enough! That's the last one!\" I kept arguing, but then each time, he'd clasp my hands and say, \"it's not paid off yet!\" He could've said anything, really.\n\nMy memory is kind of fuzzy on what I said to him, on account of all the wine. The important part was that I was trying very, very hard to impress him.\n\n\"So, I got a promotion recently,\" I said, telling him all about how I was up on the rise, and that my family promised that in a few years I'd surely make it into a really important position, maybe even guard detail for the council. And then it turned out he didn't really know how prestigious that sort of position is, anyway.\n\n\"So, I've been learning some Chinese characters lately,\" I said, telling him that we totally did have something in common after all. I may have left out the part where I've been having a hell of a time of it, and my tutor keeps giving me shit for not even half-understanding how grammar is supposed to work. Honestly, it's all beyond me, even if everyone says it's necessary to be functionally literate nowadays. I don't know how the fuck anyone can be. But even leaving that out, he wasn't impressed.\n\nI was about to order another round for us myself, but he stopped me. \"You've had enough, Mr Security Officer,\" he said, grinning. \"Let's get out of here while you can still stand.\"\n\n\"I'll walk you home,\" I offered after paying, as we staggered out the door. He had to catch me. What an embarrassment.\n\n\"Oh, dear, boy. I'll walk {i}you{/i} home,\" he said, having to hold me up to keep me steady. I don't know what I would have done without him there, even just walking the five minutes from the rail station to my home. But we got there, thankfully.\n\n\"That was fun,\" I told him from my open doorway. \"I'd like to do it again.\"\n\n\"You're kidding, right? I don't want to date you,\" he said, and my heart sunk. I felt totally horrified and shitty… for the three seconds it took until he grabbed me by the collar, pulled me to his face and kissed me. And not lightly, either. \"I want you to invite me in!\"\n\nI don't remember what happened between the doorway and my bedroom. I guess we must have managed to sneak past {a=SeungboksFather}my father{/a} and his dramas, and gotten a bottle of much cheaper wine, without it being too weird. Somehow, I guess. The rest, I'm pretty sure I'm going to remember vividly.\n\nI shouldn't describe the whole thing, but man, hottest moment: he's sitting on the edge of my bed naked—and man, I've never seen anyone look more comfortable without clothes in my life—and I'm on the floor, on my knees; you know, right where I want to be. \"Give me another drink,\" I tell him, raising my empty wine glass. He gets this totally wicked grin, then suddenly swats the glass out of my hand, and in the same gesture grabs me by the hair. \"Drink your fill, then,\" he says, pulling my head right in. It'd sound like some lame, evening drama-level shit coming from anyone else in the world, but man, fuck me if I wasn't all kinds of turned on by it.\n\nAnyway, I woke up with him prying himself out of my arms, and the worst fucking hangover in the world. I had to force my eyes open, and it took me a whole minute to sit up straight.\n\n\"Hey,\" I mumbled. \"Are you going already? Stick around.\"\n\n\"Sorry, but I have to go,\" he said, typing something into my computer screen.\n\n\"I'll make you breakfast!\" I offered. He just laughed.\n\n\"No you won't, you're a spoiled little rich noble boy,\" he said, wagging his finger at me. \"You don't even know how, you'll just get your maid to do it. No thanks.\"\n\nI wondered if I'd ever see him again. I've never had a one night stand before. I don't want to, ever, I'm sure they're not something I can deal with at all. And god damn if that boy didn't do a great job at weighing heavily on my mind.\n\nThen I realized that the clothes he was putting on seemed way too baggy for his skinny body. I rubbed my eyes.\n\n\"Uh, those are actually my clothes,\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" he responded, not stopping.\n\nI just kinda stammered, not really sure how to respond to that.\n\n\"Go back to bed, Mr Security Officer! You really need it,\" he taunted me. \"If you want your clothes back, come pick them up from the address I put in your computer.\" Then he waved, and walked out. I was still way too groggy to follow.\n\nBut oh man, I'm still excited. He does want to see me again! I'm so glad. I mean, honestly, the hangover is still killing me, and holy shit, I can't believe I spent that much money at a restaurant… but oh well, who cares.\n\nTotally worth it!"
    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-H" "japanese_for_search" "かだまとかがみ" "ほ・すんぼく" "4042ねん12つき20にち" "kr" "I knew {a=Mimi}that boy{/a} was cruel, but man, I didn't realize just how bad he was! What a fucker!\n\nSo this happened last weekend: I went over to his family's place in the plaza, at midday. The front area was all but empty… I think there may have been a customer or two that time? But only the sort who are actually there for food. I don't know why. The food is awful.\n\n\"Hey, I'm going into the back to see him,\" I said to Mimi's mother, who was behind the counter.\n\n\"Fuck off,\" the cranky old crone said.\n\n\"Sure thing,\" I said—I don't really bother arguing with her, because who cares, at the end of the day, I've still taken {a=Mimi}her son{/a} as a lover.\n\n(That's his phrasing, by the way, not mine. I would've just said I was banging him, but he told me, \"I like the sound of 'taking so-and-so as a lover.' I want to be taken as a lover. 'Taken.' That's the kind of possessiveness I like the sound of.\" I… don't really get it, and also I don't really think anyone would believe that I'm the one doing the taking. Sure, I'm taller and manlier and the noble, but he is a domineering little man in comparison to me. But if he says he likes something, then I'll do it… so he's been taken by me as a lover.)\n\nAnyway, so I walked into the PERFECTLY LEGAL FRIENDLY GAMBLING ROOM in the back. He wasn't playing, he was studying at the computer, which isn't really weird or anything, but he seemed to be studying together with some other man, which surprised me. \n\nI mean, I wasn't jealous or anything. Well, fine, maybe a little. I mean, he does flirt with a lot of men (and women, but I don't care about that) because he's trying to get money out of them, but I know I'm special. Or at least, hope that I'm special.\n\nHonestly, though, I was mostly just surprised at that point; the flirting with other men is only while playing cards, and studying together is our thing.\n\nI said hi to {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}, he turns around to wave at me, and the other guy turns around, and look, this is important, I swear: he looks JUST like me. It's fucking uncanny, okay?\n\n\"Studying hard?\" I asked {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}.\n\n\"Still classic literature. The one you said last week was so easy when you did it,\" he said, affecting a pout. It was cute, although I worried—rightly—that I had actually hurt his feelings. \"I've been really struggling, so I'm taking a break from gambling to dedicate myself to my studies.\"\n\nIn retrospect, the idea of him taking a break from gambling should've been the giveaway, but I'm dumb, apparently.\n\n\"He's been doing pretty well, though, I'm proud of him,\" his friend said.\n\n\"Want to take a break to go out for dinner?\" I offered. \"You're welcome to come too, um…\" I trailed off. \"Sorry, I don't think I caught your name.\"\n\n\"You two don't know each other already? I would've thought, since you're both…\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, surprised.\n\n\"Huh? Both what?\" I asked, confused.\n\n\"You're both from the Heo family,\" he said. \"You've really never met…?\"\n\n\"No!\" I said, earnestly surprised. I stared, trying to figure out if I'd seen him before, but I couldn't remember seeing him at any family gatherings. That didn't really mean a whole lot, though, because seriously, fuck Heo family gatherings. I pay as little attention as I possibly can to them. I don't think I could name half my cousins, truthfully. \"Were you at the last family gathering?\"\n\n\"I wasn't, unfortunately; I was ill,\" he said. Fair enough. \"But I'm Heo Seung-bok, it's nice to meet you. What's your name?\"\n\nMy jaw dropped.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I'm Seung-bok. What's your name?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Um… it's also {a=Seungbok}Seung-bok{/a},\" I stammered. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\n\"Anyway, boy, I can't do dinner out. Too poor. We could eat out in front, though,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} suggested, meaning his mother's restaurant, which is basically worse than dying.\n\nWell, thinking about it right now, maybe it's not actually shit food. Maybe she just has it out for me. Man, fuck, that's totally it, isn't it?\n\nAnyway, it didn't seem like a good idea.\n\n\"I'll cover it, don't worry about it,\" I insisted. \"For both of you. Let's just get out of here.\"\n\n\"Well, fine, fine,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} shrugged.\n\nWe went to the place across from his, which is decent enough.\n\n\"So are you also in security?\" I asked the other Seung-bok.\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" he said. \"I'm the Second Lieutenant of deck 10, actually. Yourself?\"\n\n\"Uhh…\" I felt really humbled, being WAY the fuck outranked by this guy. \"Just a lowly officer on the plaza, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no need to 'sir' me,\" he smiled. \"Are you alright? You're staring.\"\n\n{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} laughed, prodding at me from under the table.\n\n\"I'm fine! Just a little surprised, is all,\" I lied. Honestly, it was kinda freaking me the fuck out.\n\nWe talked more, even after we'd finished dinner, and frankly, I just got more and more alarmed by how much we had in common past the whole name thing. I mean, the name thing was weird, neither of the characters in mine are really common at all. And it turned out he even wrote them the same way as mine. And he ordered the same food as me right before I did. And was the same age—which made me feel pretty shitty about my own accomplishments, let me tell you.\n\n\"Men or women?\" I asked.\n\n\"Uh… oh, women,\" he answered. \"Definitely women.\"\n\n\"Well, finally, there's a difference,\" I said exasperatedly.\n\n\"Ahem,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} cleared his throat conspicuously.\n\n\"…well, except for him. He's cute enough that anyone could make an exception for him,\" the other Seung-bok said, looking at him.\n\n\"I was thinking that maybe studying together with Seung-bok could be a regular thing,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, making flirty eyes. Not in my direction. \"I'd like to get through Dream of the Red Chamber together with him, at the very least, since he's read it…\"\n\n\"So have I,\" I stammered, awkwardly trying to fight for his attention, because I am an idiot.\n\n\"Well, we've just gotten to chapter XX together… where Bao-yu sleeps in front of the mirror, remember?\" Mimi smiled. \"Besides, don't you think it would be nice, me being together with Seung-bok and {a=Seungbok}Seung-bok{/a}? I wouldn't have to take up so much of your time, so you could focus more on exams so you could get promoted…\"\n\nI just gaped in horror at his proposal, as if he could fucking suggest such an awful thing! I wanted to spend more time with him, not less! And it was just… fuck, the thought that I was basically replaceable in his eyes? I'd been worried about that in our relationship, that I was just some interchangeable noble in his eyes, and this was just making that all worse.\n\n\"I really don't think… um… that's just kind of…\" I stammered something like that. I can't remember the exact wording. \"{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}, I don't want to be replaced with some mirror version of me, that's—\"\n\nAnd then I stopped mid-sentence.\n\n\"Do you think he's figured it out yet?\" the mirror Seung-bok asked him, trying to stifle laughter. \"I can't keep this up anymore.\"\n\n\"I told you he hadn't read it!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said enthusiastically.\n\n\"…you're fucking with me,\" I finally said.\n\n\"A little,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said.\n\n\"Come on! Dream of the Red Chamber! You were supposed to have studied literature as part of becoming an officer!\" the mirror Seung-bok said to me, suddenly switching to a lot less stilted voice. \"You don't remember the part where Bao-yu meets the other Bao-yu? The thing we spent the past hour re-enacting?\"\n\n\"…I was never really good with classical literature,\" I admitted.\n\n\"See? I'm right, aren't I?\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} asked, looking at the mirror Seung-bok expectantly.\n\n\"…well, alright, fine, {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a},\" he said, reaching into his purse and putting down money on the table. Like I said before: of course it couldn't be true that {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} was taking a break from gambling. Who's a giant fucking idiot? This guy. \"I cracked up before he figured it out, you win. I'm speechless.\"\n\nThen he said goodbye and left.\n\n\"Fucking hell, I can't believe you'd do that to me!\" I yelled at him, honestly upset. \"{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}, you giant fucking cock!\"\n\n{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} got up, and came over to my side of the table, sitting next to me.\n\n\"Well, you're an idiot for believing it,\" he said, wrapping his arm around my shoulder. I… well, I was upset at him, but I have a hard time saying no to physical comfort from him. Even when I think he's an asshole.\n\nThen he looked at me very suddenly and intensely, and said: \"There's no such thing as mirror versions of someone. There's no such thing as someone out there who is like you, except more desirable. You're special to me, and I can't believe you're actually stupid enough to think that I could find any way to replace you at all. There's no such thing as someone who I'd love in the way I love you. Am I perfectly clear?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I croaked. I felt pretty humbled and touched. Still upset, but mostly touched. It was sweet, in his own awful way.\n\n\"If you're not too mad at me, I'm going to kiss you now, and it's going to make me really happy, because you're special and have a good taste and are someone I love,\" he said, leaning close. \"If that's alright with you.\"\n\n\"…yeah, it is,\" I reluctantly said.\n\nCruel fucker!"

    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-B" "japanese_for_search" "ろーせずさとられず" "すみす" "4038ねん9つき16にち" "kr" "{a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} has once again tried my patience by requesting a meeting with me and {a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a} at a very specific time and location, then showing up late! The subject was so important, I had no choice to put up with it, but it doesn't mean I appreciate the utter lack of respect. She insisted on meeting in the upper plaza restaurant Royal, and her lieutenant {a=Seoyeong}Heo{/a} was the first there, but it took {a=OldMute}the Councillor{/a} herself a whole half an hour for her to finally show up on our private room's screen.\n\n\"Hey! Sorry I'm late!\" she announced in the same perfect gratingly cheerful voice she's had for the past fifty years. \"You didn't start eating without me, did you?\"\n\nHow irritating.\n\n\"We'd never do that! Should I pour you a glass of wine?\" asked {a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a} cloyingly, raising the pitcher in her direction. He's always been like this with her, ever since he inherited his council position. I can never tell if he understands the implications of her being an immortal computer program, or if he's just an idiot. Probably he's just an idiot.\n\n\"Ha ha, man, I wish. With the sort of shit we've got to deal with, I sure could use it,\" she said, with a slight flip of her golden hair. Then she turned to me. \"Anyway… {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a}, I bet you're wondering why I asked you here, right?\"\n\n\"You said it was important,\" I said, impatiently.\n\n\"It's about the Committee for Freer Democracy,\" she said, with appropriate scorn emphasizing their name. \"This week, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a} has literally done nothing but shut down their meetings. How many noise violation orders have you issued in the past seven days? Ten?\"\n\n\"Fifteen,\" said {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a}. It was a dramatic tactic on {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}'s part; as if she didn't know exactly how many.\n\n\"My bad,\" she said. \"And every week, the number of private log entries using their keywords doubles. I'm worried we're going to be reaching a critical mass soon. At this rate, I'm worried that the Presidential election results are going to lead to, like, public demonstrations. We can't deal with that.\"\n\n\"You're the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, it's your damned job to deal with it,\" I told her. \"I'm not interested in excuses.\"\n\n\"She's not making excu—\" {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a} started, out of line, but {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} managed to muzzle her.\n\n\"Stand down, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a},\" she told her. But then she turned to me with the same rudeness: \"Now listen here, young man. I was not, like, asking your approval. We have a problem, and a stern lecture from the {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a} is not going to help. Okay? You can blame me if you want, but that's not going to solve shit.\"\n\n{a=Yang}Yang{/a} stifled a grin, thinking that I wasn't looking; I had to glare to put him back in line. Sheepishly, he took a large drink of his wine.\n\n\"I'd at least like to know why it is that you can't even do your job effectively,\" I demanded. \"At least show some respect.\"\n\n\"Okay, uh, sure. You got it, {i}sir,{/i}\" she said sarcastically, an impossible expression on her face. \"But I think, {i}sir{/i}, you misunderstand what my job is. My job isn't to stop public demonstrations. My job is to make sure public demonstrations don't happen in the first place. Like, do you have any idea what happened the last time we had public demonstrations?\"\n\nShe paused. She expected me to actually answer her question, prepared to pounce the moment I got even the slightest detail wrong. I tried to recall, but she said something before I had the chance to say anything.\n\n\"No, of course you don't, it was like four centuries ago. They led to open, armed rebellion. We're talking about outright banditry, okay? This is not tenable. {i}Sir,{/i}\" she said, in a high-and-mighty way. \"Do you have any idea what martial law is like? 'cause that's what it took to crush it last time.\"\n\n\"So,\" interrupted {a=Yang}Yang{/a}, \"you're saying that carrying out your job needs our help.\"\n\n\"You got it, {a=Yang}Councillor{/a},\" she said. \"Look, there's no need for hostilities, men. We've got a common problem here, and I think we can sort it out. And really, {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a}… in my opinion, as {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, and as the eldest person around by like a millennium, I think we can sort this out. But I wouldn't have asked you here if I didn't need your help.\"\n\nI sighed. She had a point. If I had to clean up what she couldn't, that's her job. \"What's your plan?\"\n\n\"You're not going to like it,\" she said, and I was sure I believed her. \"First, we let {a=Park}Park{/a} back in the Presidential race. That's what the agitators have been getting upset about it, so it'd take the wind right out of their sails if we take away their main point of contention.\"\n\n\"That's madness! He's a radical, and he'd very likely be elected!\" I said.\n\n\"What's the worst that happens? We just veto the bastard down at every step. The President's powerless against the Council in the end,\" {a=Yang}Yang{/a} suggested.\n\n\"No, no. No good. I mean, you're right, but that'll just lead to more unrest,\" she said, shaking her head.\n\n\"What the hell do you propose, then? Just let him dictate his crazy radical anti-noble policies?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Yeah. Actually. I think that's our best shot. Hear me out, okay? You resign as Chief Councillor—and don't give me shit, here, I know you've been meaning to for ages, don't pretend like you'd be upset for that to happen. We put in someone new, younger, as the face of the Council. Say it's part of our new direction. The President's going to call for reforms, and we're going to let him, and our new direction will be going along with them.\"\n\n\"So we just yield to the madness of democracy, then?\" I said incredulously. She sounded absolutely insane. But of course, she had a plan, I'm pained to admit.\n\n\"No, that's crazy, of course not,\" she said, and then she grinned madly. \"We pretend to. We're going to be the democracy movement's worst friend. If the President proposes reforms, yeah, we'll nod along, we'll say we'll do it… then we'll water it down. We'll stall. 'cause, like, here's the thing: the people, they don't have specific demands. They're dumb, they're okay with compromises. All we have to do is make it look like they've won, and the movement loses all its momentum.\"\n\n\"And then… rebellion crushed!\" said {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a}, smashing her fist into her palm dramatically. \"Efficiently, and subtly.\"\n\n\"You got it. Efficient and subtle. That's how we do it,\" said {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}.\n\nI wasn't sure at first what I thought of her plan. It's insane, for sure. It's incredibly bold. But the more I thought about it over dinner, I thought, maybe that's what we need. In all the time I've known {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, she might try my patience, but I've never known her intentions to be misplaced. She might be chatty, and a gossip, and disrespectful, but one thing is for sure: she's honest, and never manipulative. I think there's a reason why she came to my face and asked me this, when she could have just gone around me with the rest of the Council. She might be a bitch at times, but she's still programmed to always act in the best interests of the ship's safety. Always.\n\nBy the time we'd finished eating, I'd just about made up my mind.\n\n\"Who do you propose as the new face of the Council, then? You?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ha ha, oh, please.\" She shook her head dramatically. \"I said a younger face! Mine's as old as it gets.\"\n\n\"Only by choice,\" {a=Yang}Yang{/a} said. \"You can always look as young and beautiful as you'd like.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. I've done that before, and when the fashions change, I'm sure I'll do it again,\" she started.\n\n\"I think you look fine the way you are, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a},\" said {a=Seoyeong}Heo{/a}, an odd tone to her voice.\n\n\"It's not the point, okay?\" She shook her head, looking exacerbated. \"We need someone who's actually young, who the peasantry will trust as a being willing to accept new ideas.\"\n\n\"{a=Lee}Councillor Lee{/a}, perhaps,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Ah, no, definitely not. Too charismatic, too ambitious. That woman has got an agenda, and I do not trust it for a second,\" she said. She was probably right, on reflection. \"{a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a}, who would you suggest?\"\n\nHe paused. Then a flash of light seemed to go off behind his dim eyes.\n\n\"{a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu Hyeon-su{/a},\" he said. \"Give it to the useless figurehead {a=Ryu}Councillor of Captaincy{/a}. He'll be so thrilled to actually have a real job, he'd never think to do anything with it.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said too, after a pause of reflection. \"He's young, completely malleable, but plausible as a reformer. As the face of impotent rebellion… {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} would be perfect.\"\n\nThat was where we left the discussion for that night. And now, I guess it's time to tell my wife that I'll finally be retiring. She'll be thrilled."
    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-C" "japanese_for_search" "せんきょびのよる" "ほ・すんぼく" "4038ねん11つき29にち" "kr" "Man, I had the weirdest fucking night.\n\nDespite half the security force being pulled in to guard polling stations on election night, I was off duty at the time, watching dramas with my similarly off duty {a=SeungboksFather}father{/a}. (I'm not a fan, but he is. I find them pretty unbelievable, honestly.) Anyway, he got the idea from one of the episodes that now would be the perfect time to send a gift to {a=Seoyeong}Chief Security Officer Heo{/a}, my aunt in the main branch, to say thanks for giving us the worst night off. Not that he actually had anything suitable, of course. He spent like ten minutes scrounging and was only able to find a moderately expensive-looking wine bottle we'd been ignoring for years. He seemed to think it made perfect sense. Well, whatever, that's dad-logic, I guess.\n\nSo I took it down the corridor to the main branch family's home. {a=SeungboksFather}My father{/a} suggested it'd be a quick five minute in-and-out affair, but it took five minutes at the doorbell just to get any sort of response. Whatever, it's not like I had anything better to do. A cute maid answered the door. She looked pretty sheepish.\n\n\"Can I see {a=Seoyeong}Chief Heo{/a} briefly?\" I asked her. \"If it isn't trouble.\"\n\n\"Sorry… she's out right now,\" she said quietly, still halfway behind the door.\n\n\"Is {a=Kim}her husband{/a} home, then? I have something to drop off,\" I said.\n\n\"He's home, but… uh…\" She suddenly blushed, and looked away. \"{a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} is… he's busy right now, and not to be interrupted. Sorry…\"\n\n\"I just have something to drop off, it'd only take a minute,\" I said.\n\n\"I… really couldn't interrupt. {i}Busy,{/i}\" she said awkwardly, looking down and scratching her neck. It'd taken me a sec to catch her meaning.\n\n\"And {a=Seoyeong}Chief Heo{/a} is at the office?\" I asked.\n\n\"…yes,\" she said quietly. \"Sorry, I have to go now…\" And then she closed the door on me without another word.\n\nIt was pretty fucking awkward, but whatever, I figured I might as well go try to deliver it to her office. I figured I should at least be able to say that I tried in good faith and all. And man, good thing I did, too.\n\nPretty much all the desks in the main security office were empty, although all the lamps were still lit. Apparently I interrupted her in the middle of a conversation with {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} herself.\n\n\"Yes, mister? Can I help you?\" she said to me.\n\nI introduced myself as {a=SeungboksFather}her brother{/a}'s son. It probably could have gone better. \"He wanted to send you a gift. As a thanks for working so diligently on the hardest night.\" Or something like that. Maybe with more stammering.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"it most certainly is the most difficult night.\"\n\nAt that point, as if on cue, she got distracted by a message in her earpiece.\n\n\"Oh, don't say that,\" she replied to the voice in her ear. \"Are you serious? Are these reliable reports?\" After a pause, she filled a shot glass with something from her shelf, and slammed it back. \"I will kill them,\" she said. \"If you see anyone carrying anything that even looks like political signs, I want them set on fire. Not the signs, the men. Actually, the signs too. The point is, I want them dead!\" she shouted.\n\nAt that point, I was ready to leave, and just waiting for a pause so I could excuse myself.\n\n\"Okay, belay that,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said from the nearby screen, pantomiming an earpiece of her own. \"Lieutenant, do not murder anyone. Elections with murders in them pretty much always turn into disasters. Let's not do that, please.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine, no murders. Continue to monitor the situation,\" she said. Then she turned to {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}. \"For now, I'd recommend some unscheduled maintenance on the rail corridor the fake ballots were spotted on.\"\n\n\"Already done,\" {a=OldMute}the Councillor{/a} said. \"Can we send a team to intercept them?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said {a=Seoyeong}Heo{/a}. \"We're already spread thin as it is. If we just sent a couple uniforms in, to be blunt, I don't think they could take out the protestors efficiently. It would cause a scene.\"\n\n\"Really? You can't do better than that? I'm disappointed,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said. \"I expected better.\"\n\n\"Regardless, I don't think they could,\" she replied directly.\n\n\"Fine. Guess we'll have to avoid that. The last thing I want to hear are rumours that the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} is stifling the democratic process. That'll really agitate the damned democracy agitators,\" she said bluntly. I was surprised to hear it from the {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a} herself. I mean, not that I'd ever heard anything from her before, but it sounded surprising. \"Bunch of idiots. Don't they know that their candidate has already won? What's the point in protesting for {a=Park}Park{/a} when he already has the Presidency in the bag?\"\n\n\"Are you sure you don't want to set them on fire?\" she suggested.\n\n\"Man, knock it off. Murder is going to lead to rioting. Let's avoid that kind of shit, please,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} replied, rubbing her forehead. \"Hey, if you're spread so thin, why is he off-duty?\" she asked, glancing at me. I was way past the point of not wanting to be there.\n\n\"That's a good question. Why are you, officer?\" {a=Seoyeong}my aunt{/a} asked, staring.\n\nI stammered, \"I don't have a weapons permit yet, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, it might be prudent to get one, don't you think?\" she replied.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what I said. Something like \"yes ma'am,\" I think. But it seemed like the perfect chance to get out of there, so I excused myself and did.\n\nI'm not really sure what they were talking about, even now. I didn't hear anything about trouble with protesters, and I've definitely heard no end to family members complaining about {a=Park}Park{/a} being elected, so they were right about that. I guess they managed to sort it out, somehow.\n\nIt sure was weird, though. And I guess maybe I should try for that weapons permit?"

I'm so happy to see her dress like that, when the fashion lately has been for women to wear long dresses and seem less imposing, she's really done the opposite.\n\nI think she's the most gorgeous she's ever looked, grey hair and all.

I don't think I've ever met a single person who thinks these Heo family gatherings are any fun. Everyone I've talked to seems to secretly hate them, every single one, but we all pretend to care and take interest in how every random unimportant cousin has been doing, and who's just got married, and who fucking cares about it all.\n\nThis time someone apparently paid serious money to hire an entire troupe of actors to perform short scenes in the living room, which at least shut down the conversation. Unfortunately, the performances were complete shit. I needed to get away, and slipped out between sets under the pretense of trying to find the washroom, in the hopes of falling in and therefore having an excuse for not being around.\n\nInstead, while I was wandering the halls of the main branch's absurdly large home, I ended up stumbling on the weirdest scene: a table with a card game in-progress on it, with an {a=Kim}old professor of mine{/a} at one end, and a mostly-naked flatchested maid sitting on strewn-about clothes.\n\n\"Uh, sorry… I was, uh, looking for the washroom,\" I said sheepishly, and started to back away. It wasn't even like the door was closed, I wasn't trying to sneak in anywhere. They were just there for anyone in the hall to see.\n\n\"Wait! Don't go, cute boy!\" the maid called out. \"Do you want play hwatu? We could really use a third.\"\n\n\"Uh… is that okay?\" I asked, looking at {a=Kim}the professor{/a}, terrified that I had interrupted an intimate moment. Then I remembered the last time I'd visited their home looking for {a=Seoyeong}his wife, the Chief Security Officer{/a}, and how he was indisposed then, too. That was a weird fucking night.\n\n\"Yes, if you have silver to play for,\" he said with a shrug. It really did seem like he didn't care.\n\n\"Uh, sure,\" I said. Even then I got the feeling I was about to be hustled, but whatever. \"Anything to escape the family.\"\n\n\"I hear that,\" he said. \"Bloody in-laws.\"\n\n\"Uh, I'm a Heo too,\" I said, then I introduced myself. \"You're {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a}, right? I had you in an Earth history class.\"\n\n\"Let me guess: first year?

It probably didn't help that after putting our silver for the stakes, {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} kept pouring me more and more to drink.\n\n\"That's a really unusual name. Is it your real one?\" I asked {a=Mimi}the maid{/a}.\n\n\"Nope!\" was the only response.\n\nI kept trying not to stare, and it wasn't working. Maybe that's what the nudity was for, to win at cards by means of seduction. I mean, man, it sure worked. It was pretty hard to not get caught up thinking about how soft that bare skin would feel against my hands and instead worry about my hand in the game.\n\nIt was also losing me a rapid number of points. At first I didn't realize just how badly I was doing, because I assumed my real threat was {a=Kim}the professor{/a}, and he always seemed to be at the same point I was. And {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} was only whittling us down very slowly, never calling \"go\" no matter how big the lead was. The next thing I knew, we were both out.\n\n\"Oh, wow, I won!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} exclaimed with a girlish giggle. \"I feel like I'm on a roll! How about another, but with higher stakes? A five-silver per point?\"\n\nAnd that was the hustle.\n\n\"No bloody way. I know when I'm done,\" {a=Kim}the professor{/a} said. \"I'm sitting this one out.\"\n\nI would be lying if I said the reason why I went in wasn't simply because I was attracted and wanted to spend more time with {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}. I mean, I figured I'd be able to make back my money, because I couldn't really take that giggling very seriously. But mostly it was attraction.\n\nIt ended pretty quickly. Three rounds in, I had arrogantly raised the stakes, then promptly got utterly swept with a single play that took my opponent from 0 points to having more than enough to wipe me out. Twice.\n\n\"Go or stop?\" I asked.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\n\"That, uh, puts me in an awkward position,\" I explained. \"If you do that, you'll win, and I'll be out, and I don't have anything more in my purse. But I'm having a lot of fun playing with you, so if you say go, we can take another few rounds.\"\n\n\"Nope. Stop!\" was the response, followed by a cutesy head tilt. Then I watched as my money got swept off the table. \"I'm not playing for fun. I'm playing for money!\"\n\n\"You're vicious,\" I teased.\n\n\"I have to be!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} exclaimed. \"I've got tutors for my entrance exams to pay for, and I am but a poor little thing!\" The last word was dragged out. It was a little bit too cutesy.\n\n\"Tutors? The exams aren't that hard,\" I said.\n\n\"Ha! And when did you take them? 4030?\" {a=Kim}the professor{/a} scoffed.\n\n\"Uh, '37. I'm not that old,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, they were a lot easier then. Anyone could get in. How many Chinese characters do you know, kid?\" he asked, rolling his eyes at me. I thought back to school. He was actually my least favourite professor. I thought he was pretty obnoxious.\n\n\"I dunno. Not many,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Yeah, right. Nowadays, you need to know a thousand in order to get in. Mind you, you'll have trouble in a lot of Classics classes if that's all you know, but it's the bare minimum,\" he told me.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, well, that's what's important nowadays,\" he said.\n\n\"How's that?\" I couldn't imagine why.\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" he said. \"I'm a History professor. It's way out of my bloody field; I don't care about Confucius. If I had it my way it'd still be like it was before.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said.\n\n\"Hence all the tutors!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, pouring me another drink. \"Hey, how about another game?\"\n\n\"I think he's had enough to drink,\" {a=Kim}the professor{/a} said. In retrospect, he was absolutely right.\n\n\"I'm fine, I can handle it,\" I said, absolutely wrong. \"I'm in security, we drink pretty fucking hard.\"\n\n\"So {a=Seoyeong}my wife{/a} keeps complaining,\" he responded. \"Fine, if we're in the 'stupid' part of the evening, I'll leave you two to it. Have fun, kids.\" He turned to look at {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}. \"I'm going to go find the maid you swindled that uniform from, since half the work's done for me. Give it back when you're done.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} responded.\n\n…oh. That completely went over my fucking head at the time, on account of the drinking. I just realized right now: the \"joke\" was that {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} had stolen the maid's clothes and their rightful owner was presumably naked somewhere. Holy fucking yikes, man. I totally did not get that at the time.\n\nAnyway, then I was alone, for which I was kinda glad, because it gave me a chance to get closer.\n\n\"So, another game?\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} asked.\n\n\"Uh… my purse is empty, I've got nothing,\" I said. \"Play just for fun?\"\n\n\"I only play for keeps. How about I loan you back the 600 silver you just lost?\" Even I could tell this was a bad idea at this point. Too bad my dick couldn't, and it was what was making decisions for me at that point. \"I'll need to take something as collateral.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, far too quickly.\n\n\"A kiss,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} responded, smiling coyly at me, a finger against the lips. I was wrapped around that finger at this point.\n\nTo make a long story short, I naturally agreed, and the kiss that was taken from me was amazing. You know, the kind that just makes you want more and more, and frustrates you. That was the point, I have no doubt. It fucking well worked. I didn't want to win back my money, that was just money. I wanted to win {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}.\n\nAnyway, I sure didn't win back the money. I was cleaned out in ten minutes.\n\n\"Well, I'm off,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, starting to pull the strewn clothes into something more proper-like.\n\n\"Wait!\" I said, not actually having a follow-through. I just stared for a moment trying to think of something. \"How am I going to pay you back?\"\n\n\"{a=Seungbok}Heo Seung-bok{/a}? I'm sure I can find you.\"\n\n\"How about I pay you with dinner sometime?\" I asked.\n\n{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} laughed. \"Cute boy, you know I'm not a girl, right?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do you think I would've let you kiss me if you were?\" I asked. I thought it was the coolest fucking line at the time. It wasn't. True, but definitely not fucking cool.\n\n\"You're funny,\" he said. \"I'll see you around.\"\n\nI sure hope so. After he left, I stumbled back out to the main party, thankfully to discover that the actors were done and that there was now food to be had. Which I sure needed. I really couldn't get that card hustling boy, and the sight of his really gorgeous body, and that kiss, out of my head. Still can't. Eventually the family members just stopped bothering me because I was pretty clearly spaced out by thinking of him.\n\nI only feel a little bit bad. If I'm going to get played, man, it could be a lot worse than by someone like that. A lot worse. Damn. I sure hope I see him again."
    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-G" "japanese_for_search" "あいつは" "ほ・すんぼく" "4042ねん10つき24にち" "kr" "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck everything, hangovers SUCK.\n\nAll told, I spent a lot more on that dinner than the 600 silver that I owed {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}. There goes my whole first fucking paycheque after my big promotion.\n\nTotally worth it!\n\nIt took an obnoxiously long time to actually track him down even after I worked up the guts for it. It turns out I was a lot braver with him while not sober. But even after working it up, and asking {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} to get in touch with him, I never heard a word back from that boy. After a few months, eventually I gave up.\n\nThen suddenly, near the end of my last shift of the week doing patrols of the plaza, I ran into him. Well, more like he ran into me. Knocked me RIGHT over onto my ass. I was about to curse him out, but then he offered me his hand, and I realized who it was.\n\n\"Sorry. Come on, hurry up!\" he said, helping me to my feet, then suddenly starting to run, still holding my hand. I had no choice but to follow him. I didn't want to let go and miss my chance!\n\nWe spent a good minute darting through corridors and between shops, and even took a shortcut through a tea house that was definitely the kind of shit I'd normally give someone a citation for.\n\nAnyway, eventually we stopped to catch our breath, and he explained that he was running away from a couple of men who were angry at him because he'd cleaned them out gambling.\n\nI checked the time: officially off the clock.\n\n\"Let me make it up to you, buy you dinner,\" I said, in a perfect world where I'm actually as charming as he is and don't choke on my words in front of a pretty face. I'm not even going to write down what I actually said. I'm hoping by the time I read this again, I'll have forgotten it entirely. [[EDIT: Well, that sure was wishful thinking.]\n\n\"Take me to Golden House, then,\" he said with a lilt to his voice.\n\n\"Uh, I don't think I can afford that,\" I tried to protest.\n\n\"Sure you can! And you owe me, big time,\" he said.\n\nAfter more back and forth of that, I relented. I pretty much had to.\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'll take you to Golden House. But only because it'll clear my debt,\" I said. …and because, honestly, I did want to impress him deep down. Um, I mean, deep down, I did want to impress him. The thing I wrote before sounds way more dirty than I meant. Me am no good with words.\n\nAnyways! I took him there, and while I don't really know much about western style food, it seemed pretty good to me. He just kept ordering more wine for the both of us.\n\n\"That's enough! That's the last one!\" I kept arguing, but then each time, he'd clasp my hands and say, \"it's not paid off yet!\" He could've said anything, really.\n\nMy memory is kind of fuzzy on what I said to him, on account of all the wine. The important part was that I was trying very, very hard to impress him.\n\n\"So, I got a promotion recently,\" I said, telling him all about how I was up on the rise, and that my family promised that in a few years I'd surely make it into a really important position, maybe even guard detail for the council. And then it turned out he didn't really know how prestigious that sort of position is, anyway.\n\n\"So, I've been learning some Chinese characters lately,\" I said, telling him that we totally did have something in common after all. I may have left out the part where I've been having a hell of a time of it, and my tutor keeps giving me shit for not even half-understanding how grammar is supposed to work. Honestly, it's all beyond me, even if everyone says it's necessary to be functionally literate nowadays. I don't know how the fuck anyone can be. But even leaving that out, he wasn't impressed.\n\nI was about to order another round for us myself, but he stopped me. \"You've had enough, Mr Security Officer,\" he said, grinning. \"Let's get out of here while you can still stand.\"\n\n\"I'll walk you home,\" I offered after paying, as we staggered out the door. He had to catch me. What an embarrassment.\n\n\"Oh, dear, boy. I'll walk {i}you{/i} home,\" he said, having to hold me up to keep me steady. I don't know what I would have done without him there, even just walking the five minutes from the rail station to my home. But we got there, thankfully.\n\n\"That was fun,\" I told him from my open doorway. \"I'd like to do it again.\"\n\n\"You're kidding, right? I don't want to date you,\" he said, and my heart sunk. I felt totally horrified and shitty… for the three seconds it took until he grabbed me by the collar, pulled me to his face and kissed me. And not lightly, either. \"I want you to invite me in!\"\n\nI don't remember what happened between the doorway and my bedroom. I guess we must have managed to sneak past {a=SeungboksFather}my father{/a} and his dramas, and gotten a bottle of much cheaper wine, without it being too weird. Somehow, I guess. The rest, I'm pretty sure I'm going to remember vividly.\n\nI shouldn't describe the whole thing, but man, hottest moment: he's sitting on the edge of my bed naked—and man, I've never seen anyone look more comfortable without clothes in my life—and I'm on the floor, on my knees; you know, right where I want to be. \"Give me another drink,\" I tell him, raising my empty wine glass. He gets this totally wicked grin, then suddenly swats the glass out of my hand, and in the same gesture grabs me by the hair. \"Drink your fill, then,\" he says, pulling my head right in. It'd sound like some lame, evening drama-level shit coming from anyone else in the world, but man, fuck me if I wasn't all kinds of turned on by it.\n\nAnyway, I woke up with him prying himself out of my arms, and the worst fucking hangover in the world. I had to force my eyes open, and it took me a whole minute to sit up straight.\n\n\"Hey,\" I mumbled. \"Are you going already? Stick around.\"\n\n\"Sorry, but I have to go,\" he said, typing something into my computer screen.\n\n\"I'll make you breakfast!\" I offered. He just laughed.\n\n\"No you won't, you're a spoiled little rich noble boy,\" he said, wagging his finger at me. \"You don't even know how, you'll just get your maid to do it. No thanks.\"\n\nI wondered if I'd ever see him again. I've never had a one night stand before. I don't want to, ever, I'm sure they're not something I can deal with at all. And god damn if that boy didn't do a great job at weighing heavily on my mind.\n\nThen I realized that the clothes he was putting on seemed way too baggy for his skinny body. I rubbed my eyes.\n\n\"Uh, those are actually my clothes,\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" he responded, not stopping.\n\nI just kinda stammered, not really sure how to respond to that.\n\n\"Go back to bed, Mr Security Officer! You really need it,\" he taunted me. \"If you want your clothes back, come pick them up from the address I put in your computer.\" Then he waved, and walked out. I was still way too groggy to follow.\n\nBut oh man, I'm still excited. He does want to see me again! I'm so glad. I mean, honestly, the hangover is still killing me, and holy shit, I can't believe I spent that much money at a restaurant… but oh well, who cares.\n\nTotally worth it!"
    tl_hateplus_message "2-1-H" "japanese_for_search" "かだまとかがみ" "ほ・すんぼく" "4042ねん12つき20にち" "kr" "I knew {a=Mimi}that boy{/a} was cruel, but man, I didn't realize just how bad he was! What a fucker!\n\nSo this happened last weekend: I went over to his family's place in the plaza, at midday. The front area was all but empty… I think there may have been a customer or two that time? But only the sort who are actually there for food. I don't know why. The food is awful.\n\n\"Hey, I'm going into the back to see him,\" I said to Mimi's mother, who was behind the counter.\n\n\"Fuck off,\" the cranky old crone said.\n\n\"Sure thing,\" I said—I don't really bother arguing with her, because who cares, at the end of the day, I've still taken {a=Mimi}her son{/a} as a lover.\n\n(That's his phrasing, by the way, not mine. I would've just said I was banging him, but he told me, \"I like the sound of 'taking so-and-so as a lover.' I want to be taken as a lover. 'Taken.' That's the kind of possessiveness I like the sound of.\" I… don't really get it, and also I don't really think anyone would believe that I'm the one doing the taking. Sure, I'm taller and manlier and the noble, but he is a domineering little man in comparison to me. But if he says he likes something, then I'll do it… so he's been taken by me as a lover.)\n\nAnyway, so I walked into the PERFECTLY LEGAL FRIENDLY GAMBLING ROOM in the back. He wasn't playing, he was studying at the computer, which isn't really weird or anything, but he seemed to be studying together with some other man, which surprised me. \n\nI mean, I wasn't jealous or anything. Well, fine, maybe a little. I mean, he does flirt with a lot of men (and women, but I don't care about that) because he's trying to get money out of them, but I know I'm special. Or at least, hope that I'm special.\n\nHonestly, though, I was mostly just surprised at that point; the flirting with other men is only while playing cards, and studying together is our thing.\n\nI said hi to {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}, he turns around to wave at me, and the other guy turns around, and look, this is important, I swear: he looks JUST like me. It's fucking uncanny, okay?\n\n\"Studying hard?\" I asked {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}.\n\n\"Still classic literature. The one you said last week was so easy when you did it,\" he said, affecting a pout. It was cute, although I worried—rightly—that I had actually hurt his feelings. \"I've been really struggling, so I'm taking a break from gambling to dedicate myself to my studies.\"\n\nIn retrospect, the idea of him taking a break from gambling should've been the giveaway, but I'm dumb, apparently.\n\n\"He's been doing pretty well, though, I'm proud of him,\" his friend said.\n\n\"Want to take a break to go out for dinner?\" I offered. \"You're welcome to come too, um…\" I trailed off. \"Sorry, I don't think I caught your name.\"\n\n\"You two don't know each other already? I would've thought, since you're both…\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, surprised.\n\n\"Huh? Both what?\" I asked, confused.\n\n\"You're both from the Heo family,\" he said. \"You've really never met…?\"\n\n\"No!\" I said, earnestly surprised. I stared, trying to figure out if I'd seen him before, but I couldn't remember seeing him at any family gatherings. That didn't really mean a whole lot, though, because seriously, fuck Heo family gatherings. I pay as little attention as I possibly can to them. I don't think I could name half my cousins, truthfully. \"Were you at the last family gathering?\"\n\n\"I wasn't, unfortunately; I was ill,\" he said. Fair enough. \"But I'm Heo Seung-bok, it's nice to meet you. What's your name?\"\n\nMy jaw dropped.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I'm Seung-bok. What's your name?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Um… it's also {a=Seungbok}Seung-bok{/a},\" I stammered. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\n\"Anyway, boy, I can't do dinner out. Too poor. We could eat out in front, though,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} suggested, meaning his mother's restaurant, which is basically worse than dying.\n\nWell, thinking about it right now, maybe it's not actually shit food. Maybe she just has it out for me. Man, fuck, that's totally it, isn't it?\n\nAnyway, it didn't seem like a good idea.\n\n\"I'll cover it, don't worry about it,\" I insisted. \"For both of you. Let's just get out of here.\"\n\n\"Well, fine, fine,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} shrugged.\n\nWe went to the place across from his, which is decent enough.\n\n\"So are you also in security?\" I asked the other Seung-bok.\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" he said. \"I'm the Second Lieutenant of deck 10, actually. Yourself?\"\n\n\"Uhh…\" I felt really humbled, being WAY the fuck outranked by this guy. \"Just a lowly officer on the plaza, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, there's no need to 'sir' me,\" he smiled. \"Are you alright? You're staring.\"\n\n{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} laughed, prodding at me from under the table.\n\n\"I'm fine! Just a little surprised, is all,\" I lied. Honestly, it was kinda freaking me the fuck out.\n\nWe talked more, even after we'd finished dinner, and frankly, I just got more and more alarmed by how much we had in common past the whole name thing. I mean, the name thing was weird, neither of the characters in mine are really common at all. And it turned out he even wrote them the same way as mine. And he ordered the same food as me right before I did. And was the same age—which made me feel pretty shitty about my own accomplishments, let me tell you.\n\n\"Men or women?\" I asked.\n\n\"Uh… oh, women,\" he answered. \"Definitely women.\"\n\n\"Well, finally, there's a difference,\" I said exasperatedly.\n\n\"Ahem,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} cleared his throat conspicuously.\n\n\"…well, except for him. He's cute enough that anyone could make an exception for him,\" the other Seung-bok said, looking at him.\n\n\"I was thinking that maybe studying together with Seung-bok could be a regular thing,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said, making flirty eyes. Not in my direction. \"I'd like to get through Dream of the Red Chamber together with him, at the very least, since he's read it…\"\n\n\"So have I,\" I stammered, awkwardly trying to fight for his attention, because I am an idiot.\n\n\"Well, we've just gotten to chapter XX together… where Bao-yu sleeps in front of the mirror, remember?\" Mimi smiled. \"Besides, don't you think it would be nice, me being together with Seung-bok and {a=Seungbok}Seung-bok{/a}? I wouldn't have to take up so much of your time, so you could focus more on exams so you could get promoted…\"\n\nI just gaped in horror at his proposal, as if he could fucking suggest such an awful thing! I wanted to spend more time with him, not less! And it was just… fuck, the thought that I was basically replaceable in his eyes? I'd been worried about that in our relationship, that I was just some interchangeable noble in his eyes, and this was just making that all worse.\n\n\"I really don't think… um… that's just kind of…\" I stammered something like that. I can't remember the exact wording. \"{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}, I don't want to be replaced with some mirror version of me, that's—\"\n\nAnd then I stopped mid-sentence.\n\n\"Do you think he's figured it out yet?\" the mirror Seung-bok asked him, trying to stifle laughter. \"I can't keep this up anymore.\"\n\n\"I told you he hadn't read it!\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said enthusiastically.\n\n\"…you're fucking with me,\" I finally said.\n\n\"A little,\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} said.\n\n\"Come on! Dream of the Red Chamber! You were supposed to have studied literature as part of becoming an officer!\" the mirror Seung-bok said to me, suddenly switching to a lot less stilted voice. \"You don't remember the part where Bao-yu meets the other Bao-yu? The thing we spent the past hour re-enacting?\"\n\n\"…I was never really good with classical literature,\" I admitted.\n\n\"See? I'm right, aren't I?\" {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} asked, looking at the mirror Seung-bok expectantly.\n\n\"…well, alright, fine, {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a},\" he said, reaching into his purse and putting down money on the table. Like I said before: of course it couldn't be true that {a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} was taking a break from gambling. Who's a giant fucking idiot? This guy. \"I cracked up before he figured it out, you win. I'm speechless.\"\n\nThen he said goodbye and left.\n\n\"Fucking hell, I can't believe you'd do that to me!\" I yelled at him, honestly upset. \"{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a}, you giant fucking cock!\"\n\n{a=Mimi}Mimi{/a} got up, and came over to my side of the table, sitting next to me.\n\n\"Well, you're an idiot for believing it,\" he said, wrapping his arm around my shoulder. I… well, I was upset at him, but I have a hard time saying no to physical comfort from him. Even when I think he's an asshole.\n\nThen he looked at me very suddenly and intensely, and said: \"There's no such thing as mirror versions of someone. There's no such thing as someone out there who is like you, except more desirable. You're special to me, and I can't believe you're actually stupid enough to think that I could find any way to replace you at all. There's no such thing as someone who I'd love in the way I love you. Am I perfectly clear?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I croaked. I felt pretty humbled and touched. Still upset, but mostly touched. It was sweet, in his own awful way.\n\n\"If you're not too mad at me, I'm going to kiss you now, and it's going to make me really happy, because you're special and have a good taste and are someone I love,\" he said, leaning close. \"If that's alright with you.\"\n\n\"…yeah, it is,\" I reluctantly said.\n\nCruel fucker!"

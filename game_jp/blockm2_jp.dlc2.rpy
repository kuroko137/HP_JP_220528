    tl_hateplus_message "3-2-A" "japanese" "SO COOL" "{a=Jina}Mae Jin-a{/a}" "April 25, 4041" "kr" "Dear diary,\n\nAaaaaaaaa, today was such an awesome day! I had to work at the family's stall in the market again, and that super pretty woman came by to get flowers again! I made up my mind this morning that if she came back this week too, I'd say more to her than just \"welcome!\" and the price, and and and and this time I really did! And she was super nice to me!\n\n\"Welcome!\" I greeted her when she showed up at the same time she had for the past three weeks. \"Um… the usual, then, miss?\"\n\n\"Yes, please,\" she said in a reaaaaaaaally gorgeous voice. It's a little bit husky, and really pretty… and oh, speaking of pretty, I figured out why she always looks so glamorous! It's because she really is an actress! I bet she always plays, like, really cool characters… she could do it so well.\n\nBut I didn't find that out right away, so I didn't know how far out of my depth I was yet! While I was cutting the stems of the flowers she always asks for, I tried to think of something to say.\n\n\"So, um… I guess you really like camellias, don't you? They're really pretty… I think they seem to suit you…!\" I babbled, unable to think of anything coherent in time.\n\n\"Hm?\" she asked, and suddenly I got really tense. Did she think I was an idiot? Did I just make an idiot of myself babbling like that? I was sure I had and she was judging me! Harshly! I think I blushed a little. But then she smiled at me. \"Oh my, no, they're not for me. I don't think they suit me at all.\"\n\nI bundled the flowers and handed them to her, avoiding eye contact, and not saying anything. I'd done enough damage, I thought!\n\nThen when she took them, she held them up beside my face, and I got a close look at her hand. Normally you couldn't see it because of her really long sleeves, but… oh my gosh! They were really pretty too, and really clean and smooth-looking and pretty much the exact opposite of mine. She even had really bright red nail polish and I was really envious of how cool she was.\n\nI was still trying to avoid eye contact, but she stared at me, as if she was sizing me up. \"Hm, yes. I think camellias go far better when contrasted with cute flowers, personally,\" she said. \"See? Perfect match.\"\n\n\"Huh…? Oh! Ah…\" I murmured, in confusion, but then in a couple seconds realized that she was talking about me. Oh my gosh, what a cool line… wasted on me? I definitely definitely know I blushed more at that and looked away. I was completely completely out of my depth… and I knew she knew it, and was playing with me! \"Thanks…\" I said quietly.\n\nThere was a long pause where I didn't want to say anything more and embarrass myself, and definitely didn't want to look up, but she just kept standing there! I wondered why she was doing that, and considered it was entirely just to make me squirm. Was this revenge for saying anything at all? I should have said nothing, I thought to myself… then I wouldn't be embarrassing myself in front of such a cool person. Why won't she go and let me wither away from shame on my own? Why, why didn't she go, I kept thinking.\n\n\"Um… pardon me,\" she said. \"But how much money do I owe you?\"\n\nAnd that was the moment I just turned completely and totally red. Oh my gosh, I just wanted to die of embarrassment right there on the spot. I could not have been more embarrassed.\n\n\"Ah, sorry sorry sorry sorry! Just a second, that's… 10 silver, please. Sorry…\" I stammered.\n\nAnd then I had a second, crazier thought: if I couldn't be any more embarrassed, then what did I have to be afraid of?\n\n\"So, um, who are the flowers for, then?\" I asked, forcing myself to look at her. \"Someone important to you?\"\n\nShe paid me, and shook her head. \"Ha… well, I suppose he's a good enough friend, but it's hardly what you're thinking of. They're for the play we're running. The actor who performs opposite of me needs to wear one in his hair for the third act. It's just not the same without real flowers. If you use fakes… you'll lose your sense of playful elegance. It's awfully important.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. I'm not really sure what she meant by that last part, but I didn't really want to admit it. \"So… you're an actress, then!\" It was unexpected, but I wasn't surprised. She was certainly pretty and calm and waaaaaay cool enough to be one! I was even more amazed that someone like that could be talking to me. So out of my depth…!\n\n\"I am,\" she said, managing to make it sound so cool, so dramatic. Just like an actress would, I guess! \"Are you a fan of the theatre, then?\"\n\nI turned blank. What could I say? \"No, sorry, just a peasant! I could never afford that!\" crossed my mind, but that would just be too much, and I really wanted to impress her. Or at least, not make her turn away in disgust. I tried to think of something!\n\n\"Um, I don't know,\" I said honestly. \"But I do like dramas…\"\n\n\"Ah, well, they're not an awful lot like that,\" she said, but it didn't sound too dismissive. And I couldn't have been more embarrassed anyway so it was fine. \"Hm, perhaps… would you like to see our performance tomorrow night, then, so you can judge for yourself? You can see if we embody 'playful elegance' with your own eyes—which are rather pretty when you look up, I may add.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say that!\n\n\"Ah, um, well… uh… if it's not too much trouble!\" was all I could think of.\n\n\"Hardly!\" she said. \"What's your name, dear?\"\n\n\"Ah… um, it's {a=Jina}Mae Jin-a{/a}…\" I trailed off.\n\n\"Oh, that's a cute name. It fits. Very well, {a=Jina}Miss Mae Jin-a{/a},\" she said, still so cool. \"If it pleases you, I'll have your name be put on the guest list. It's at the Silver Eternity theatre at 7 tomorrow. I'd love to see you come.\"\n\nCould I really turn down a request like that? No! \"Okay…! Thank you! Um, I'll see you there…\" I said.\n\n\"Goodbye now. Take care, cute flower,\" she said, then walked away. \n\nOh my gosh, SO COOL. I don't really know how to deal with any of this and I'm kind of scared to go tomorrow and I know I'm definitely way way way out of my depth, but still! She's an actress! And she was nice to me despite me being an idiot at her! Oh my gosh, what an awesome day, I just can't deal with this… even if I'm scared, I really really can't wait to see her again. Lucky! Get chance! Ah, she's just so cool..."
    tl_hateplus_message "3-2-B" "japanese" "The Hairpin" "{a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a}" "April 26, 4041" "kr" "My performance last night must have been my worst yet. I got no less than a dozen lines wrong, including the \"no unplucked flower\" one, meaning that the entire meaning of my speech at the climax was reversed. To say nothing of the entire cue that I missed while I was worrying about missing a cue.\n\nTo say that it was disastrous would be a dramatic understatement. It was calamitous, utterly amateur hour on my behalf, and I have the utmost certainty that even the audience could tell. And of course, this was the performance to which I had invited the girl with the flowers from the other day, the one I was trying to impress. I would have died of shame on the spot if I could.\n\n\"Utterly calamitous! I completely undermined the whole meaning!\" I argued with the others, pouring myself another glass of well-needed wine. Somehow even my co-star wasn't taking me seriously.\n\n\"It's a complicated play, love. Nobody other than us noticed it, I guarantee it. They just go off what the program describes it as meaning, anyway,\" {a=Taemi}Tae-mi{/a} said, rolling his eyes. \"Please stop self-effacing for attention.\"\n\n\"I am doing no such thing!\" I protested. I looked to the other girls in the group, but they just shrugged. But before I could say anymore, the door slid open, one of the stagehands appearing.\n\n\"Uh, sorry… {a=Aejeong}Miss Heo Ae-jeong{/a}? There's a common girl who's really insistent on seeing you, she says she knows you. What should I say?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh no, {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a}?\" I winced. I couldn't face her, not after that disaster. \"Tell her I'm not here. Tell her that I have died. Tell her that I have died of shame and therefore am not here.\"\n\n\"…I'll say that you're busy,\" he said, uncomfortably.\n\n\"Wait, wait, who's this {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a} that you're so afraid of? The great and haughty {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a}, scared of a commoner?\" {a=Taemi}Tae-mi{/a} mocked. \"Send her in, send her in! This must be seen.\"\n\n\"Okay, sir,\" the stagehand said, and closed the door, despite my obvious distress.\n\n\"Please, at least treat her nicely,\" I implored {a=Taemi}Tae-mi{/a}.\n\n\"Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to be mean to her. I'm going to be mean to you,\" he declared. I was about to respond by asking how I might be able to tell the difference, but at that moment, the door slid open.\n\n\"Uh… sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt!\" she exclaimed, bowing unnecessarily. \"I just wanted to thank {a=Aejeong}Miss Heo Ae-jeong{/a} for inviting me here… sorry for the trouble, I'll be going now…\"\n\n\"Come in, come in! Any friend of {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} is a friend of ours, I insist,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, um… I'm not really…\" she said quietly, glancing at me, seeming worried. I gave her a sympathetic look. \"I mean, um, okay! Thanks…!\"\n\nI made room for her at the table, and she knelt down next to me. I smiled at her, and tried to reassure myself that I hadn't really lost the upper hand. Perhaps she didn't know just to what extent I had utterly destroyed myself on stage. Perhaps.\n\n\"That's a nice dress,\" he told her. It really, really wasn't. She'd tried her best to look… well, I don't know what her expectation of what one wears to the theatre is, but I'm sure she tried her best. It was cute, it was endearing that she tried, but it was very certainly not a nice dress. He was making fun of her, after all. I winced. It wasn't fair, she hardly could know better.\n\n\"Ah, um, thank you!\" she stammered. I wanted to die, right there, on the spot. Or swoop in and rescue her with a clever repartee. But before I had a chance to think of anything to say, she just looked at him, with a look of amazement, and said, \"Um, there's just one thing I'm confused by, though.\"\n\nI looked away. I was simply unable to watch this unfold. I had invited her here, and he was simply going to devour her whole. I had not understand just how truly calamitous this was.\n\n\"And what's that?\" he asked with a smirk.\n\n\"Um, well, it's something {a=Aejeong}Miss Heo Ae-jeong{/a} was telling me! She said it's impossible to embody, um, 'playful elegance,' if you use mock flowers, right?\" she asked. I looked straight down. She was just too naïve for this, she was going to be destroyed.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay! That makes sense!\" she said, enthusiastically. Then she said the unexpected: \"So, um… then don't you also lose the playful elegance if you use mock compliments?\"\n\nI suddenly looked up out of shock, and there was silence. She just tilted her head, looking cutely, as if she really did expect an answer. After a moment had passed for it to sink in, the girls giggled. I thought she hadn't understood… but no, she knew exactly when she had been the butt of the joke, and she had just absolutely called him on it, in the most adorable, most natural-seeming way. I may nearly have swooned on the spot. I thought I'd impress her when I invited her here, but instead, I was the one who was impressed.\n\n\"You're right, you're right,\" he said, shrugging it off. \"That was unbecoming of me and I apologize.\"\n\nI was very truly impressed.\n\nThe tone of the conversation was respectful after that. She really was naïve, it turned out, but after a drink or two, she freely confessed to it in a way that was just the most endearing thing in the world. We explained the play to her, and I even admitted to her just how disastrously my performance had gone, even after it was clear she couldn't tell. And her response was simply to smile innocently at me, and say with the utmost sincerity, \"It's okay… I'm sure you'll get it perfect next time!\" It was the sweetest thing.\n\nEventually, all the other actors took their leave, simply leaving us alone together backstage, entirely too drunk, and entirely too close together. And I was just smitten with her at this point.\n\n\"I have immensely enjoyed your company tonight,\" I told her. \"Without a doubt, you are, far more than I, the absolute embodiment of playful elegance.\"\n\n\"Oh, please, don't be silly…\" she said.\n\nI clasped her hand with mine. \"I mean it truly,\" I declared. I'd like to think I had some sort of segue into what I said next, something that made it seem natural, and not just an act of forwardness that would be excessive even for me. But I cannot remember saying anything of the sort, unfortunately. All I remember was staring deep into her eyes, and declaring, \"If it'd please you, I'd rather like to kiss you right now.\"\n\nShe blushed profusely, and I immediately regretted saying that, realizing I had moved remarkably too fast. And was acting remarkably too drunk.\n\n\"Um… okay! Sure…!\" she stammered, sounding reluctant.\n\n\"My apologies, I shouldn't have said that… I don't know what I was thinking. Please, forgive me,\" I said to her.\n\n\"Ehhh? No, I'd…\" She looked down. \"I'd really like it if you did! Please! Th-that'd be nice…\"\n\nI raised her chin with my finger, so I could look her in the eyes. \"Really?\" I asked with uncertainty.\n\n\"R-really!\" she stammered, trembling slightly as I stared her in the eyes. \"I mean, if you want! It's okay if you don't! I was just… I think… ahh, geeze, I'd just like it if you did… really!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said. Then I leaned forward, clasping her hands, and gently kissed her quivering lips. They felt so delicate against mine, and I could nearly taste her surprise. Then I kissed her once more, unable to help myself. \"You smell nice, little flower,\" I said softly to her.\n\n\"Th-thanks…\" she said. When I pulled away, she was still blushing bright red, still quivering, but she grinned at me. Then a worried look overcame her face, and she looked around the room. \"Oh no… is it midnight already? Oh geeze! I'm so late, I should have been home ages ago, I have to leave! Sorry!\"\n\n\"Ah, I'm sorry, forgive me… you don't have to say that,\" I told her, letting go when I realized I really just had scared her off. I'd come on to her too strongly, and she wanted to be a good sport… but the kiss really did scare her off. What a fool I am, I thought. \"I'll let you go. I didn't mean to push you like that…\"\n\n\"No, no! I liked that! I-I'm flattered that you'd even look at me like that! Ah, I mean it!\" she said, rising to her feet.\n\nI shook my head. \"You don't need to say that… don't worry about offending me, I understand. You don't need to worry about seeing me again, so don't spare my feelings.\"\n\n\"I-I'm not!\" she exclaimed. \"I like you, I think you're really cool… please, believe me!\" Then she pulled out an ugly hairclip from her hair, and handed it to me. \"Here, hold onto this! I'm not giving it to you… I want it back, okay? I'm trusting you to hold onto it until I can be with you again!\"\n\nI took it from her, not sure what to say. She started to run away, shouting back at me, \"Um, bye for now! 'Til next time!\"\n\n\"'Til next time…\" I said, trailing off, watching her run away.\n\nOnly once she left did I realize that my heart was actually racing. {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a} may be cute and timid, and as fun to play with as I had expected, but… well, I certainly had not expected her to grab hold of my heart like that. I thought I'd be the one to sweep her off her feet, impress her, be the charming one. But all I could think was that I'd surely just given my worst performance yet, and somehow the audience was receptive all the same; and despite the stammering, and the excitement, and the blushing, I had no doubt that she was far more graceful than I had been.\n\nRight after she left, I clipped her pin in my own hair."

In one of her recent performances, she was so visibly spaced out she completely missed cues, and delivered many of the show's important monologues with the stiffness of a stale noodle. I can only speculate as to why, but it's been troubling to watch.\n\nLately, however, we've seen a real return to her previous form; {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} is as enchanting as a dream, and her on-stage chemistry with her co-star {a=Taemi}Tae-mi{/a} produces unbelievably convincing tension. For three hours, she becomes the perfect embodiment of love and scorn, taking you through the play's myriad complex turns and betrayals.\n\nAnd make no mistake: this is a difficult play. Don't Pick the Flowers presents the story of the charismatic veteran Earth politician Anna Harper ({a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a}), whose charm belies a vicious revenge plot against the seductive serial killer Ansuh ({a=Taemi}Lee Tae-mi{/a}, in yet another cross-dressing role), a playboy who uses his status to escape the law. It's a chilling story of manipulation, and the entire play is a duel of wit and charm between the two, a complicated dance where one is never sure who is ahead until the end. In the hands of a less skilled cast, or any other director, it could be a mess. But {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} and {a=Taemi}Tae-mi{/a} are entrancing, and when done right, the confusion only helps to sell their roles even more.\n\nIf you only see one play this year, it absolutely must be this. I don't know what's happened to {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} to bring her back to grace, but we're all the better for it. Five stars.\n\n{i}Don't Pick the Flowers is currently being performed at the Silver Eternity theatre.{/i}"

I just got home, and after I finish eating I need to get to work, but right now I gotta write this all down because aaaaaaaaaa, girl-feelings!\n\nYesterday on our date together, {a=Aejeong}Ae{/a} actually held my hand! In public! I thought she was worried about being seen with me like that before, but I guess she changed her mind. And that was even before dinner! I mean, afterwards I wouldn't have been surprised, 'cause she insisted on us going through a looooot of wine together, and she gets really possessive of me when she does that.\n\n\"Please, my dear, I insist,\" she told me as she ordered the second bottle. \"Money might be tight these days… but it's worth it to see you get all giggly and affectionate.\"\n\n\"Whaaaaat! I don't even know what you're talking about!\" I said, but then I couldn't help but giggle. \"Oh, fine…\"\n\n\"I mean it truly, especially with how little I seem to see you lately,\" she said sadly.\n\n\"Well… we'll be able to spend more nights together once we're able to get a place of our own! Right?\" I asked. I really can't wait until we can. If I could take her back to my home it would be fine, but ha ha oh no, no WAY am I sleeping with her with my parents on the other side of the screen. Getting a place of our own on the same deck is still the only option. I can't wait…!\n\n\"Right,\" she said, and then took another drink.\n\nAfterwards, we went back to her cozy apartment behind the theatre, and we drank some more. It pretty quickly got to the point in the evening where she could just not keep her hands off me, which oh my gosh, I just still cannot deal with it at all. AT ALL.\n\n\"Y-you know,\" I stammered, \"if you keep being like that with me in public, all those fangirls who call you 'Big Sister' are going to get jealous!\"\n\n\"My, are they, now?\" she said in that super husky voice of hers that just totally makes me melt. Then she started to stroke my hair! \"I wish… sadly, there's not many of them anymore. Single girls just don't go to the theatre these days, it seems…\"\n\n\"Good!\" I said. \"I want you all to myself!\"\n\n\"I do miss all the love letters, though… my, they would say the most flattering things,\" she teased me. Then she walked over to the futon, and slipped out of her dress like it was the most natural thing ever, and oh my gosh just every time I see her naked I am just so blown away. That gorgeous black hair resting on her soft, totally smooth perfect curves, and those long legs and long fingers and perfect… just… geeze, I have to stop, I can't do her justice at all with my babbling! But aaaaaaaaaa, she could do anything to me after seeing that, and she knows it!\n\n\"W-well, I could call you that too… and, um, I know way more about what makes you beautiful than all those girls did, anyway…!\"\n\n\"Do you?\" she said, staring at me… and giving me THAT look. Good thing I was waaaaaaay drunk past the point of anything but blushing all the time, 'cause that really really would've done it otherwise and then she'd just tease me for that, too! \"Come here,\" she told me, gesturing. I had no choice but to do what she said!\n\nShe undressed me quickly. It's… her way of showing that she's in control, and I still get pretty nervous! I mean, really, I'm just terrified… what if she realizes just how much out of my depth I am, compared to her? It's not as bad as it used to be, especially that first time she saw my boobs… but oh my gosh I just feel so aware of how gross and sweaty my body is and how it's got little hairs where she's perfectly smooth and how my boobs are tiny compared to hers and just… I don't know what she sees in me! I love her and I know she loves me back but I just don't get it sometimes…\n\nBut then she pulled me onto her lap and we kissed and then we both giggled at how we tasted like the peach drinks we'd just finished off. Every time we do this I just suddenly really REALLY want to play with her boobs, because oh my gosh they are the softest. Then she gives me a look and I stop, but… well, after a while this time I just couldn't get over how perfect her body is. This isn't just lovestruck rambling! It really really is perfect.\n\nI ended up kissing her neck, and even that was just so soft. I don't really know what came over me, but… I kinda really felt like biting her! I don't know, I feel bad now, but I just felt like I really wanted to leave a blemish on that super-perfect body of hers. And I guess, um, to show that she was taken. I don't know, it's stupid and sounds awful when I say it now. But I started out gentle and she let me, so I kept going, and didn't even stop when she cried out. I didn't even think to stop! All I could think of when I heard that moan of hers was that gosh I wanted to hear more.\n\nWhen I pulled my head back to look at her, it was just… gosh. It really did stick out, so much, her complexion perfect and skin totally smooth in every other way, except for that big red blemish… and knowing that it was mine! I felt like I really wanted to do it again, but then she grabbed me strongly, and kept kissing me. Then she pinned me down and went at it more! I wanted to apologize, but she wouldn't even let me say anything. But I'm pretty bad at using words around her. I'm… really glad we have a relationship like this, because if I couldn't kiss her, I don't know if I could her ever really tell her how I felt.\n\nThen she went down on me and I just completely totally melted under her. I really wish I'd done the same for her, even though she's pretty much a natural at making me cry out and I never know what I'm doing, but we pretty much both passed out right there before I could. When we woke up, we were both just all tangled up together naked, on top of her sheets, and she'd slept with her head on my waist.\n\nI really really didn't want to leave. I hate the mornings after! Why do our amazing evenings have to end?! Gosh, I'm just… so in love with her! I wish it was possible to just spend an entire day with her and not worry about having to work and scramble home in the morning and aaaaaaagh, why don't we already live together? It's not fair!"
    tl_hateplus_message "3-2-E" "japanese" "I hate the mornings after (2)" "{a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a}" "June 13, 4042" "kr" "With every passing day comes increasing worries about what the next will bring. My only reprise from my fears comes during my rare dates with my cute flower {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a}, but more and more I truly hate these mornings after; for she has to return to the world of commoners and family, and I will return to mine to discover that attendance at the Silver Eternity has dropped again, and such-and-such patron has threatened to rescind their donation. Beside me, I watch the naked form of my love selfishly sleeping as I write, and I have both overwhelming desire to join her, and trepidation towards the inevitable awakening the next morning. I long for nothing more than to be able to rest my head on her forever and never have to leave.\n\nYet I cannot, and I know that things are troubled. Before she arrived at the theatre to pick me up, I was in conversation with a patron who offered—as many others have—to alleviate all my financial worries, at the price of offering him something of mine that my beloved wants all to herself. I let him show the typical amount of inappropriate affection, his hand on my cheek as he made his extraordinary demand; and when I declined, it was not out of a sense of dignity, but out of love for {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a}. Still, she walked in that sight, and while she said nothing, I am certain that it worried her.\n\nI tried to make it up to her with displays of over-affection, as I cannot bear the thought of worrying her cute little head. I held her hand as we walked to the restaurant, and even let her order a second bottle of wine. Every time I am with her, my mind enters an endless spiral of worries that the moment is wrong, or that I am not delivering enough. I don't know if that will ever go away. Perhaps that's simply how love is. Despite my age and my pretenses, I have little genuine experience in such matters.\n\nWhen we returned to my dingy room behind the theatre, we ended up drinking more still, and it's in that state I find myself to be so emotionally vulnerable. \"These days, there seem to be no single girls in attendance at the theatre—only families, and grandmothers, and old men,\" I lamented. \"Gone are the days of rich girls lining up to deliver love letters to me; do I miss them so.\"\n\n\"You'll have to settle for me!\" she said, with her usual indifferent enthusiasm. I don't know how she keeps it up. I envy it; it's what gives me the energy to keep going, remembering that innocent smile of hers. I wanted her so much. I wanted to embrace her, and to be overwhelmed with immediate passion for her, such that I could forget my lamentations and melancholy and simply live in the moment where I am naked before her excited smile.\n\n\"I know more about what makes you beautiful than all those girls did, anyway,\" she told me, appraisingly, as I undressed and waited for her in bed.\n\n\"Do you?\" I wondered wistfully. She did, of course; she knew my vulnerability, she knew my weakness. With all those girls, even when I took them off to my bed, it was always so easy to me. I always knew that I was prettier, and more desirable, and more confident, and that not even for a second would I ever lose control of the situation. I would make them squirm, and gasp, and shudder for my amusement, at my will, never fearing that I was ever giving any less than exactly what they wanted from me. With her, though… it's special. I feel as though I have to try so hard to please her, as though she is the one who is perfect and in control, and I never have the confidence that I can meet her expectations. But I try so hard. \"Come here,\" I begged her, reaching out in longing. For some reason, the thought that she might not came to mind, and scared me. But she did.\n\nI undressed her when she let me, letting her show that she was in control even in that facet. We kissed, and when she started to giggle, I could scarcely help myself from doing the same, despite my worries and melancholy. Then she took my body onto her lap, and my chest into her strong, calloused hands, gripped me tightly; only enough for a tease, though, only enough to make me stare at her longingly for the feeling of her rough fingers playing with me. My breasts themselves were only in her grip for seconds, but my heart still now remains ever-firmly in her grasp.\n\nThen she started to bite my neck. At first, gently, to give me a chance to decline—as if I could say no to her—but then stronger, until I couldn't help but moan in pain and delight. When she was done, I touched my neck; it was so sensitive, so tender compared to the skin around it, and I felt so happy that she had found a way to leave me with something, an outward show of her love that wouldn't disappear when she left for work. I had to thank her, I had to kiss her, showing my gratitude in the most eloquent way I know how. \n\nAs I pinned her down, giving her attention where she most deserved it, I felt like for that moment, all our barriers to communication had been lifted, that I knew what I was doing was good enough for her, and what she wanted from me, and that I had nothing else in the world more to worry about save for trying to draw more pleased noises out of her. She got louder and louder as I dedicated myself to her, letting out the most perfect wavering murmurs, gripping tightly to the sheets. I wish I could have heard that last ecstatic moan again and again; it was what I was longing for, her most explicit display of love and approval.\n\nAnd then she fell asleep, and I was brought back to the real world, the one where I can only rarely see my love, where the holder of that innocent smile speaks of naïve dreams of living together that with each day we can afford increasingly less; and so I write down my feelings in the hopes that I can hold onto them when she leaves, and perhaps find strength and comfort in them.\n\nAnd now I will go sleep at her side as long as I am able. And naked before her, adorned only by her mark on my neck, I'll declare I love her as much as I hate the mornings after."

It's about Miss Hong ({a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a}), a trouble-making schoolgirl with a heart of ice, and her overwhelmingly generic upperclassmen Kil ({a=Taemi}Lee Tae-mi{/a}), who for reasons of plot contrivances end up chasing around and antagonizing each other for two long acts, until the end, where Hong is naturally tamed and the two marry. As far as this kind of mediocre play goes, it's the best I've seen; but the pinnacle of mediocrity is still mediocrity.\n\nThe problem is it doesn't tell a compelling story, or have any cohesive themes, because it's not supposed to. It's designed to be broken up into short, humorous scenes, each with a punchy conclusion, so that they'll work out of context when performed in front of a private home audience as a form of disposable entertainment. (See our editorial this month for a less cranky take on the changing demographics of the theatre—Ed.) And it is disposable entertainment. This is a play that's supposed to be funny even if your mother-in-law is talking through half of it, and… to its credit, it succeeds on that merit, but so what? Is that really the highest goal theatre has now? Is this truly the best use of the amazingly-talented Eternity troupe's time?\n\nAnyone who truly cares about art in theatre will continue to be dismayed. With all that said: if there is one woman in the world who can sell the implausibly bitchy jerk turning into a lovestruck wife, and imbue the role with perfect comic timing, it's {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a}. And {a=Taemi}Lee Tae-mi{/a} manages to own his character through sheer force of his own personality whenever he's on stage—although unfortunately, lately his roles at the Silver Eternity's actual theatre have been performed by understudies.\n\nIf you like this sort of thing, Rendezvous in the Dark is absolutely worth seeing. If you only go to the theatre to leer at beautiful actresses… well, you can't go wrong with the ever-lovely {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a}. More discerning audiences should stay away from the pale shadow of what the Silver Eternity used to be. Two stars.\n\n{i}Rendezvous in the Dark is currently being performed in its entirety at the Silver Eternity theatre, and selections are a part of the troupe's private performance set.{/i}"

Does my presence in her life bring her hardship? By being the subject of her impossible dreams, do I only cause her more suffering when the seams of the artifice become exposed? I fear that I give her false hope, a false sense of security, and that it will only make things worse when I fail her.\n\nWorse, I find myself shielding her from the truth. I wanted to tell her about the patronage that I had been reluctantly forced to consider, that was my intent when I came to see her. I knew something so pivotal to my future, and therefore hers, was something I needed to discuss with her.\n\nWhen I arrived at her family's stand on the plaza, at closing time, a man who I rightfully assumed was her father was engaged in an intense-looking conversation with her. I would have stood nearby in wait for them to finish, but when he saw me, he walked out without another word; a troubled look was on his face as he passed me by, and he just shook his head at me. In retrospect, I know exactly what the look signified, and I cannot in good faith disagree with the sentiment, for I know it was out of earnest concern for his daughter's—my love's—well-being. But at the time I knew not what to make of it, and was more concerned with {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a} herself.\n\nNo smile lit her reddened face, only tears. She stared at me, quivering, light glistening off her eyes.  Then she rushed towards me, and when I hugged her tightly, she let go of whatever inhibition was holding her back and started to cry with great sadness. I felt a pang in my chest to see her so, and all I could do was stroke her hair and tell her, \"there there,\" as she cried into my shoulder.\n\nI wished I could find her a more private place than just letting her cry in public, but her home would be more crowded, and the back room I sleep in was in-use during the day. If only I still had the apartment behind the theatre. At least there weren't many people about at this hour. After a while, she calmed down a little bit, or at least ran out of energy to keep up the sobbing, and I sat her down.\n\n\"Oh, little flower. Do you wish me to get you some tea to help calm your nerves? Then we can talk about it,\" I offered.\n\nShe nodded. \"Th-thanks,\" she said, and I was grateful, because I needed it for my own nerves as much as she. I left her alone, and hurried to the nearest machine I could find in the plaza. When I returned, she didn't seem to have moved at all. I sat down next to her.\n\n\"Hey,\" I said to her, wrapping my arm over her shoulder. \"Hot or cold?\"\n\nShe sniffled. \"Hot, please,\" she said. I handed her the can; she opened it, took a very long sip, and sighed.\n\n\"Tell me about it, dear,\" I told her, pulling her in close.\n\n\"Dad wants me to get married,\" she said in a wavering voice. \"My family gets paid so little these days! It's so hard with five people in our one-room home… and, well, look at how big I am! I practically eat enough for two!\" she said, laughing awkwardly. Then she started sniffling again, and took another sip from her tea. \"I mean, it's always been crowded at home… even before grandma and grandpa moved in, and I always wanted to move out anyway, but, but, but…!\"\n\n\"…but we can't afford to,\" I said what we both already knew very well, \"or we'd be drinking wine together in a restaurant instead of vending machine tea in the back of a stall.\"\n\nShe started to cry again, and I felt another pang in my heart; my levity had only made things worse.\n\n\"Y-y-yeah,\" she stammered between sobs. \"Dad was talking to me all, 'Please just hear him out! He's a good man!' I mean, the guy himself, I'm sure he's nice! But… I want to be with you! I love you, {a=Aejeong}Ae{/a}, I just… I want to be with you…\"\n\nI held her tightly, as tightly as her poor tears gripped my heart, and I wished there was anything I could do.\n\n\"What about the stand? Wouldn't you make more money for the family if you could still work? Even if you didn't keep any wages for your own savings, perhaps it'd be better…?\" I asked, expecting there to be an answer for why that wouldn't help. And there was: apparently the flower stand barely made any money these days, and what didn't go to rent instead went for plaza bribes to desperate nobles. It sounded like the only reason they had it now still was for her own sake.\n\n\"Maybe I'll run away! I could take my savings and just sleep behind the theatre at night! And try to find odd work during the day, or or or just… something!\" she cried out, tears falling from her face. \"Do you know why this man wants to marry some girl he's never met? Do you know why? I asked! He's just as poor as us! Do you know why? Even though I'm ugly and too young and I'm just some random stranger and there's no love or anything? Taxes! Because there's some big tax break for new fathers! Taxes!\"\n\nI had, in fact, known; it was a recent big political issue, but I said nothing, and let her have her moment. She took another sip from her can, then suddenly crushed it in her fist.\n\n\"I don't want to have a kid!\" She stared at me with a look of absolute horror, starting to wail. \"I don't want to have a kid! I don't care how nice he is! I don't want to move in with some strange man, and have sex with him, and get knocked up, and then have to raise some stupid kid, and then never see you! I don't want to! I don't want to! I don't want to!\"\n\nShe started to hyperventilate, and all I could do was hold her, hush her, and tell her to breathe, until she calmed down a little.\n\n\"Maybe I'll run away,\" she said again, wiping her face with her sleeve.\n\n\"Do you think you could? If your parents were going to force you to do such a thing… would you be able to go against them?\" I asked her, knowing entirely that she never would.\n\nShe said nothing, but just grabbed me tightly and I stared at her poor swollen face, her tear-filled eyes looking so, so hurt.\n\nAnd then I thought of my own situation. How not only could I not comfort this poor hurt girl that I had allowed to depend on me for comfort, how not only had I let her down, but how also my future was just as doomed as she was having so much trouble admitting hers was. Her only hope lied in a loveless, sham marriage; mine, in the graces of a private patron. Either way our love would inevitably be torn asunder.\n\n\"At least it would offer stability,\" somehow escaped my lips. I hadn't meant to think aloud like that.\n\nShe had no words; she only grabbed me tighter, and started to wail loudly again. She cried a river of tears against my breast, sobbing uncontrollably, and I found myself overwhelmed by pity. I started to cry a little too, and forced myself to remain silent, lest I somehow found a way to worsen the scenario even more."

I hope she gets what she deserves from that man she's decided to leave me for! How could she do that to me?! Hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE HATE HATE\n\nI was at the theatre to tell her my decision abo— Oh. Oh no. Oh, geeze. I just realized how badly I screwed that up for me. All because I was stupid enough to be lovestruck by that stupid selfish woman! Oh, no, what am I going to do now?\n\nI was at the theatre to tell her my decision about that man my parents wanted me to marry. \"He was so icky!\" I told her. \"He was like a dozen years older than me! And had this beard that was just… yuck!\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure you could convince him to shave it,\" she said distantly. I was surprised.\n\n\"Don't defend him! I could never live with someone like that. Besides, I'd have to be away from you, and I could never…\" I trailed off. \"Anyway, I told him no, I was totally uninterested! And that he should go find some girl his age instead and maybe ask her directly instead of going around to her parents. My father was upset, but… I had to! So that's the end of that.\"\n\n\"We have to break up,\" she said suddenly. Nothing else, nothing leading into it, just that.\n\nI don't really remember what I said. I don't think I believed her. I know I stammered a lot. Probably \"What?\"\n\n\"There's a patron who'd like to buy me out and take me into his house. It's something I've considered for a long time now… and I'm afraid it's come to the point where it's the only recourse I can take,\" she said. \"He's made a very generous offer and I fear it would be unwise of me to decline it.\"\n\n\"'Buy you out'? What does that even mean?!\" I asked. \"Are you going to move in with this man?\"\n\n\"It means I will receive a regular stipend for performing for him and his guests exclusively, and that, yes, I will live in his house and receive three cooked meals a day and an actual bed to sleep in,\" she said. \"I have to. We get smaller and smaller audiences every week… this just isn't tenable.\"\n\nI just couldn't believe it. My mind raced. I'd just turned down an offer like that for her sake, and she did this to me?!\n\n\"Is it that man I saw you with before? The one you've been doing all those private shows for? The one who was all in your face and touching you and all 'Oh my precious {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} I would be honoured to slobber all over you like some gross man please come into my home now~'?\" I demanded. \"That guy from the Ryu house you said you didn't want to have anything to do with?!\"\n\n\"That isn't fair. Yes, it is him, but…\" she trailed off.\n\n\"Yeah, I bet he'll give you a bed to sleep in!\" I shouted.\n\n\"Don't say that, {a=Jina}Jin-a{/a}! It's not like that!\" she lied. \"Besides, even were it like that, I no longer have the luxury of being picky. If I said no, what would I do when the theatre closed down? At least you can live with your parents still. I have no such option. The man has made a kind and generous offer, and I must accept it.\"\n\n\"I… I can't believe it…\" I said, crying. \"I thought you loved me, I thought you cared for me, but…\"\n\n\"You're better off without me, anyway,\" she said. Then she told me, I can't really remember her exact words now, but she told me that she didn't feel as strongly about me as I did for her, and that she regretted being a crutch for me as long as she did, and that our relationship was a mistake, and that she should have done this far sooner.\n\n\"Fine!\" I screamed at her. \"If that's how it is… fine! I'll get out of your life and leave you alone to your precious 'kind and generous' man!\" I started to storm off.\n\n\"Wait, please, don't leave like that… please stay,\" she begged. \"Our relationship is doomed, but it doesn't mean I didn't like being with you… please, stay one more night? I couldn't bear it if my last memory of you was a sad one.\"\n\nI thought her voice was always so graceful before. Right then, I realized, it wasn't. It was pitiful. It was always pitiful. She was trying to manipulate me. Probably like she'd done with that patron. Probably like she'd done with me before. It wasn't charming. It wasn't \"playful elegance.\" It was a pitiful lie.\n\nSo I told her the truth: \"I hate you!\" I screamed at her, and ran away.\n\nI don't know what to do now. I tried not to let my family see me like this, but… well, there's only a paper screen in between us. I'm such a mess. I just can't believe she'd do that to me. I can't believe after I made the hard decision, she made the easy one, and threw me away.\n\nWriting this has calmed me down a little, at least. And now the reality sinks in. I have nothing now. I guess… I guess… I guess all I can do now is apologize to my dad, and hope that I get a second chance. I guess that's all I can do.\n\nI can't believe she'd do that to me. I hate her."

You were right; when one of the Ryu family wants to get you in their pocket, they sure don't fuck around about it. It's by far the most extravagant form of bribery I've ever witnessed. I'm pretty surprised that it's his brother that's the {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor{/a}, not him, because he seems a hell of a lot bolder to me. Are all the council nobility families like this? Because holy shit, I could sure get used to being in these ranks.\n\nHe briefly mentioned a possible deck-space deal over drinks, but mostly the evening was filled with gesturing. Hell of a job with the gesturing, though. I thought he couldn't get any crazier than when he casually mentioned busting out some vintage 4000 wine, but then he did; instead of just some regular household servant delivering it, he got {a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a} herself to do it!\n\nI saw her a couple times at the Eternity before it closed down, and she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life, pretty much. Loved her performances. And she just saunters out casually, uncorks a 40-year-old bottle, and kneels down like a common maid to pour it for us. It was unbelievable.\n\nThen she sang for us, which I'd never heard before. Needless to say, her voice was as entrancing and beautiful as you'd expect. And the wine was just as smooth.\n\nHer performance went on for about half an hour, singing about… well, the usual things. Lost love, the passage of time, that sort of sentimental shit. The theatre's slogan was \"Playful Elegance\", and holy shit does she still embody that. It's a guilty pleasure, but I can't say that her singing about past romance isn't emotionally affecting. It haunts your soul. I'm pretty envious of Ryu that he can apparently just hear that kind of performance whenever he wants, like it's no big deal.\n\nAnyway, then she sat down next to me, with her legs brushing against mine, and kept pouring me more wine. I mean, I'm not stupid, I know that Ryu was just trying to seduce me with that kind of treatment. He just wants me to imagine how impressive their bribe must be. That was the point where he mentioned the possibility of getting my family some deck-space that's more spacious than where we were before. Like, maybe even with a window to the stars. That's a romantic thought, that's for damned sure.\n\nI got a chance to talk to {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} while Ryu was in the can. Mostly I just used the opportunity to gush about how big a fan I was of hers. She was very gracious in listening to me.\n\n\"I like that hairpin you have,\" I told her. \"it's very bold.\"\n\n\"Oh, this? It's rather ugly, wouldn't you say?\" she said with a delightful laugh. \"But I promised my first love that I'd hold onto it.\"\n\nThen Ryu came back in the room, and we talked about our days at Mugunghwa University; he wanted to know what things were like nowadays, and I was pretty happy to oblige with stories from my undergraduate studies.\n\nAt the end of the evening, he said he'd save discussing business for next time, and that he wanted hear more stories about his old professors. I'm not stupid enough to think that he's interested in any legitimate friendship, but if this is what my council vote is worth, man, I'll take it. They really do not do things by half-measures.\n\nWith regards,\n{a=Tae}テ審議官{/a}"

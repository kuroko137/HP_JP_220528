The text of it can be found in the third appendix of the session's agenda. I'll now leave the floor to remarks from {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a}.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nNo remarks. It's just general housekeeping shit for the university.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nGreat. I'm going to abstain voting and decline to pay any more attention to this session, if that's okay with you.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nCouncillor…\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nIt doesn't affect Security. I vote \"don't care.\"\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…does the rest of the council object to bringing it to a vote?\n\n{a=Ryu}COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nNone here.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nI object. I don't understand the purpose of the proposed change about language rules. Is that really necessary?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nI don't think—\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nCan you explain that?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nIt's just some minor changes to general requirements. Even engineers have general requirements. That's why they're called general.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nI don't think we needed the vocabulary lesson, Councillor.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThat's—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nYes, I know, out of line. Withdrawn.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nIt doesn't sound like minor changes.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nThis was all requested and drafted by Mugunghwa University President {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}. She assures me that it's just a minor change to allow for students to get a more rounded education.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nWhat exactly is \"more rounded\" about forcing engineers into pointless general classes?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nEveryone already takes general classes, it's not—\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nPardon me, if I may?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\n…certainly, I yield the floor to {a=Lee}Councillor Lee{/a}.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nAs I understand it, the change is to allow general programs to include texts written in Chinese characters. Is that right?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nThat's what I'm told.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nMeaning technical students will have to go out of their way to learn pointless nonsense that doesn't have anything to do with science.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nChinese characters aren't taught in public schools.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nThat's right.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThe other councillors see where this is going, yes? Does it really need to be spelled out why it would be a good thing to make the educational requirements for noble professions less accessible to any old peasant at a public school?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nIn case you haven't noticed, we have a serious problem with over-educated peasants already. They agitate for democracy and give me a headache. Making things harder for them seems like preserving the status-quo to me.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThat was my thinking.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nIt's just housekeeping, regardless.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nI still don't—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n{a=CouncillorKim}Councillor Kim{/a}, do you really feel that strongly about this? Really?\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nIf you move to vote, I'll second it.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nDo we have a motion to vote?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nI move to vote, then.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nSeconded.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThe motion passes. How does the council vote?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nThe Councillor of Education is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe Councillor of Captaincy is in favour.\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Agriculture is in favour.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThe Councillor of Security wants to get this over and done with. In favour.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nThe Councillor of Justice is in favour, and agrees with the lovely {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nUgh.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n\"Ugh\" is not a vote.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nFine! The Councillor of Engineering and Science abstains. I don't care that much.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Culture is in favour.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThe Councillor of State is also in favour.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nLet the record show that the vote was 7 in favour, with 1 abstention. The amendment passes, and will go to the President for signing. With that, I move to close council for the day, to resume next Monday.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSeconded! Gladly.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThen the High Council of the Mugunghwa is dismissed."

Councillor Milquetoast can get himself seconded, but not someone who actually runs something important…?\n\n{a=Ryu}COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nCouncillor Milquetoast…?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nOkay, you're not going to call out {i}that{/i} as out of order? Seriously?\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…yes, it's out of order.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nLet the record indicate that the {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a}'s remarks were prefixed by an overly dramatic sigh.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThis is getting awfully out of control.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n{a=CouncillorKim}Councillor Kim{/a}, do you withdraw the remarks?\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nNo. I want to know what could possibly motivate anyone to nominate that man for the single highest position on the ship!\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nIt is an admittedly curious decision. Obviously I'm not completely unbiased here, but I don't think he has the track record to support such a position.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nWe've actually—\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n{a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}, if you would.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nYeah, of course. I'll be blunt: right now, the most important thing to the continued stability of this ship is in how we deal with {a=Park}President Park{/a} and this idiotic democracy movement. Right? I mean, everyone agrees with that, yeah? Therefore, our job is to undermine his actions at every turn, right? Again, nobody's arguing with that, are they?\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nHow is electing {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} as Chief Councillor going to do that? How is it not going to send a stronger message to have someone with an established record?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nI also don't understand the reasoning.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSimple: we don't want to look like the {a=Park}President{/a} is our enemy. If we strongly oppose him, we only make the movement stronger. {a=Lee}Councillor Lee{/a}, tell me, what's your proposed new direction for the council?\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nI don't propose a new direction. I don't believe in compromising to hooligans. We need to draw a line that firmly lets the peasantry know that the High Council of the Mugunghwa won't yield to their arrogance; more importantly, one that assures the noble families that actually run the ship that we won't hang them out to dry.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nI don't disagree with the principle. I don't like compromise either. {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}, I'll hand this over to you.\n\n{a=Ryu}COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIt's simple: we don't compromise. It's no new direction; it's the same direction as always. We protect the best interests of the ship, and maintain the social order that's worked for centuries. Inside this room, nothing changes.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nThen what was {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} going on about…?\n\n{a=Ryu}COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nInside this room, nothing changes. Outside… we're the face of reform. We're the best friend of the average man who got so excited to elect {a=Park}President Park{/a}. {a=Park}President Park{/a} will propose whatever nonsense he'll propose, and we'll say \"yes, of course we'll do that. With some changes—but we're just as interested in reform as you.\" But inside this room, nothing changes.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nAnd that's how it's done, boys and girls. Efficient and subtle. That's why {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a} is perfect: he doesn't have an established track record. We put him as Chief Councillor, and he says he believes in reform, they're not going to be able to argue with that.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nInteresting.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nCome on, {a=Lee}Councillor Lee{/a}. Surely you can see that this is what's appropriate for the moment. Like, under any other circumstances, you know I'd happily vote for you. Believe me, I have not safeguarded this ship's security for 1600 years just to hand it over to a bunch of fools, okay? But you know. Sometimes you give them the stick, sometimes you give them the carrot. Right now we need the carrot.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nThen we poison the carrot!\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…yeah, sure, whatever. That's… some kind of metaphor. But you see my point, Councillor?\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nWho else stands with you? {a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a}, {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}… anyone else?\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nStrongly. It's why I'm stepping down; the High Council needs a new face. A real new face, not simply the same old establishment figures the peasantry already hates.\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nIt's a good argument.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nIn that case, it doesn't look like anyone else is likely to get the six vote super-majority needed, then, is it? Alright, {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}, I hope the {a=Smith}Chief Councillor{/a}'s faith in you isn't misplaced. I withdraw my nomination.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nReally?\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nAs a point of order… it's long past the point where we usually take a break.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nIs that a motion for a recess?\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nYes.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nI'll second it.\n\n{a=Smith}CHIEF COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nVery well.

I'm tabling this one myself. You can find the text of the act in the tenth appendix of the session's agenda, as well as relevant charts and data in the eleventh through fifteenth.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nWe're sure burning through appendices fast.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nMy apologies. I'll try to keep this one concise, then, since I know you've all read this one anyway: we're approaching a serious demographic problem right now. Birth rates shipwide have been declining for years. The plan, simply put, is to provide an economic incentive for families to raise children.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nExactly what sort of numbers are you proposing? I feel like I'm being buried underneath a giant pile of data. How much is this credit for?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nNothing's being buried. It's just thoroughness.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\n{a=Smith}Chief Councillor Smith{/a} wouldn't have allowed an item to be introduced with four appendices.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThey've been available beforehand for months.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nI haven't read them either.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nI've read them. It's just unclear. What are the actual numbers?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIt's a complex breakdown with a number of factors. The bottom line, though, is that it will average to 20 000 silver for noble families per year, and 5000 silver for peasant families per year.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nLet the record show that {a=Lee}Councillor Lee{/a} just let out a long whistle. Which I'm seconding. Those are big numbers.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nI don't object on principle, but I would like an assurance that this isn't going to impact my department's budget. It's already stretched thin.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nEverybody's stretched thin.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThe projection makes it seem like it's going to have a significant cost attached to it. Like, I'm not opposed either, I get the benefits. It's just, you know, the stability I worry about.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\n{a=Smith2}Councillor Smith{/a}, if you would.\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nRight. There's no question, this will be costly. We're looking for long-term results, but certainly this is not a project that can be sustained in the long-term. If you look at appendix fourteen, you'll see that the projected cost for the next 10 years will require a 15% tax increase.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUm… that's a lot.\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nHowever, the projection also shows that with the estimated population increase—and, uh, this is being conservative, don't worry—we'll see an even payout after about 22 years. Then a significant increase.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nHow does that work?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nAppendix fifteen is a report by the Mugunghwa University Department of Economics. You'll find that it explains thoroughly.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nCertainly, Councillor, but humour me. How does it work?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nWell, uh… basically, when the population goes up, it means the workforce increases, which means there's more people to do more jobs. So there's an increase in tax revenue overall, but a decrease in government labour costs, which is always the pain in the ass. Pretty much.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nReally?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nI'm sure the {a=Oh}Councillor of Education{/a} will vouch for the quality of the university's findings.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nUh, yes, of course. I'll stand by it.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nVery well, then.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nOkay, but here's my problem: if you increase taxes on the lower class by 15%, there will be riots. Like, my office will be on fire within a week, and it turns out that costs even {i}more{/i} of the money that's already tight to put out. We're talking actual straight-out riots. It's a security problem.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nBut the benefit would be—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nI get what the benefit would be. Um, it just doesn't offset the cost of, you know, offices on fire.\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nMore workers would be a pretty good thing, though.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAre you really going to exercise the security veto over this?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nIf I may, a possible solution might be to offload the tax increase onto the noble classes.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nThis is a terrible idea! Just to hell with the whole act, I say.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nNo! It's a good idea. Peasants off having children is something I am all for. Peasants raising happy families do not set fire to anything. To be perfectly clear, I am very much in favour of the \"not setting fire to things\" option, okay?\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThe {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} may be overdramatizing a little.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nDon't sound so certain. We need to find some sort of consolation for the refusal to carry out {a=Park}President Park{/a}'s insane school credit idea. This just addresses a serious social issue as well as undercuts {a=Park}Park{/a}. If it's not this, it'll have to be something else.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nI don't care. I'm not voting for any act that'll require a tax increase, let alone one supported by noble families alone.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nYes, me neither.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThis is certainly going nowhere fast.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\n{a=Smith2}Councillor Smith{/a}?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nYeah?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (State){/a}\nI'm sure something can be changed to address the councillors' concerns, right?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nWell, uh… we could probably just take the funding from the surplus. It'll all balance out in the end anyway. I didn't think to submit any numbers on that, though.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (State){/a}\nAssuming the {a=Smith2}Councillor of State{/a} is correct, and no new taxes were levied on either the peasantry or noble class, would anyone object?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nIt'd be okay by me.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nAssuming the {a=Smith2}Councillor of State{/a} is correct, no, there would be no objection.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nYes, fine, whatever. I don't care.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nI would have no problem.\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nWhat they all said.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nGreat. {a=Smith2}Councillor Smith{/a}, please provide a new report on the feasibility of surplus financing for the Motherhood Credit Act.

Please continue, {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a}.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nIt states, essentially, that the Meritocracy exams will be run exclusively by a committee chaired by the {a=Euna}President of Mugunghwa University{/a}, composed entirely of currently-existing nobles, and that \"no person currently standing on the council will solicit or engage in any improper relationship with a member of the Meritocracy Committee with the purpose of falsifying exam results under penalty…\" of essentially being barred from the exam.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nWait, what? What does that even mean?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nNothing.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThe definition of \"improper relationship\" seems to be impossible for a family member to fulfill, is that correct?\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nThat's correct.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSo it's functionally useless, then.\n\n{a=Oh}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nAgain, that's accurate.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nGreat! I love it. Functionally useless is the best kind of function.\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nUm, then… what's the point?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe point is, my entire goal proposing the Meritocracy Act was to create the appearance of radical change that's consistent with what {a=Park}President Park{/a} has proposed, in a way that won't actually change the status quo.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nWell, that won't change the status quo, except for hanging anyone but the eight families here out to dry.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nOh no, not this again. What the hell, {a=Yang}Councillor Yang{/a}? Who really cares about the nobility status of the Kang or Han families? They're not here.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nLike, I get the concern. It feels like betraying nobles for the sake of peasants, and I don't like it either, okay? But this is pretty clearly the best way out of this problem.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nWe could stand to lose some dead weight, anyway.\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…I don't really like the tone of that.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nMan, what happened to \"no surprises\"?\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nWe've been here for nine days. Has it not been made clear that there are bigger concerns than tone, {a=Smith2}Councillor Smith{/a}?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nI would think your primary concern is that we're able to pass a budget, Councillor.\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…yeah, it is.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAre there any objections to including {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a}'s amendment to the act?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…only moral ones.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nCouncillor?\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nSorry, strike the statement from the record. No.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThen the amendment is added to the act. Who else had an addition?\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nI want to add an amendment that requires a member of each department to certify the exams.\n\nVARIOUS COUNCILLORS\n[[indiscernible interjections]\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nOrder! There will be order.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThank you. What happened to \"no surprises\"? Don't do this, Councillor.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nI'd like to second the motion for {a=CouncillorKim}Councillor Kim{/a} not to do this to us.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\nUgh… don't you want to make su—\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIt's unnecessary and transparent.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThe purpose of the act is to be subtle, and that is hardly consistent with subtle. The rules effectively allow Mugunghwa University to ensure that as is, anyway.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nLet's just move on right now, okay?\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\n…fine.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAre there any other amendments any councillors wish to table?\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nYeah, actually, I do.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nIt's co-authored by us. The text can be found in appendices one hundred and ninety one to one hundred and ninety two. The proposal is for all Meritocracy exams to be broken into several brackets, and for the councillor position to be awarded to the oldest member of the top bracket.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUh, does that really make a difference…?\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nIt's simply to ensure that someone can't take over a position just by scoring a few points better than one of us. There's some smart kids in my family. I'd rather not the position be lost to them just because of a two point difference, for instance.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nOh, okay. Fair enough.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAny objections?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe item is added to the act, then. Any other proposed amendments?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nNo?\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nCould it be that the end is finally in sight…?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nFinally, after ten thousand years of debate, it's time to vote.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIt's about time. How does the council vote on the amended act?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThe Councillor of Security is in favour.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Culture is in favour.\n\n{a=CouncillorKim}COUNCILLOR KIM (Engineering and Science){/a}\n…I still think this is a terrible idea. But I'll vote in favour.\n\n{a=Smith2}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThe Councillor of State votes in favour. But, uh, let the record show I'm not comfortable with it either.\n\n{a=Jo}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nIn favour.\n\n{a=Yang}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nThe Councillor of Justice is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe Councillor of Captaincy is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe Meritocracy Act passes unanimously, after nine days of debate. That concludes the agenda for this session. I'm personally going to motion to prorogue council until after exams are conducted, as soon as the act is signed by the {a=Park}President{/a}.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nAs soon as it's signed, and as soon as the smug jerk has choked on his \"shitshow\" crack.\n\n{a=Lee}COUNCILLOR LEE (Culture){/a}\nI'll second the {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor{/a}'s motion.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAssuming the act is signed with no problems, we'll reconvene after the Meritocracy exam results are confirmed.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSeeya in three months, then.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nLet's go home, councillors.

This is the first session since the Meritocracy exams, and there's a lot of new faces here. Congratulations, councillors.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nPlus one very old face.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nCouncillor, boy, you're not going to go very far if you don't learn to respect your elders, like, now.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nJust an observation.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\n…moving on. There are a lot of items on the agenda that have been put forward by various councillors. Unless you'd rather spend your time bickering, I'd suggest we get started.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…okay, let's get on with it.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nFirst on the agenda is a tribute consolidation proposal from {a=Smith3}Councillor Smith{/a}. You can find the full text of it in appendix one. You have the floor, Councillor.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThanks, sir. I'd like to propose moving a variety of small taxes and tributes and consolidate them into—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nNo. Absolutely not!\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nIf you'd just let me finish, I think you'll find it agreeable.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUh, you're proposing that the noble families save some money by dumping it on the peasantry. This is absolutely crazy.\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Engineering and Science){/a}\nYou know, I read the proposal, and it seems like this is shit that should be covered by them anyway. It's not like nobles have use for, for example, the inner deck rail system. What's your problem, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}?\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nI am also in favour.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nGood for you. My problem, {a=CouncillorHan}Mr Han{/a}, is that this is going to be a heavy burden on a peasantry that, as of this moment, actually doesn't hate us right now. Like, seriously, is that going to be the first action of the new High Council, piss away all our goodwill? We're really okay with that?\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nI think everyone but you is \"really okay with that\", yes.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nI don't care. I'll security veto if I have to, okay?\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…can she do that?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIf there's cause for it.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThere is all kinds of cause for it! It's tantamount to declaring war on the peasantry, which would be really stupid after all we've worked for. And it's also a security risk. We do that, it's going to lead to public demonstrations. Look, like, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, okay? I get it, I totally do! You're right, transferring it would be more fair, and I'm sure everyone here wants to save the extra silver. And you're new, so like, I get it, but you need to understand: that is not how we do things here. The makeup of the council may have changed, boys, but it's still important that we're subtle in our actions. This is not subtle, okay?\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nThat's sanctimonious.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThat's the truth.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nLook, no vote is going to happen on this, okay? No matter what. Take the proposal back and find a way to do it that won't enrage the peasantry, then we'll talk about it again. That's the bottom line.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nIf that's the only way.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nIt really is.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThen let's move onto the next order of business. {a=Tae}Councillor Tae{/a} and {a=Oh2}Councillor Oh{/a} have a proposal that would—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nNo!\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nPardon me?\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nWill you not even let me speak?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSave your breath. It is a terrible idea. The effect will be that no peasant will be able to use any of the ship's computers. You realize this, right?\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nThat isn't what it says—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nOh, come on! You know that's going to be the effect, though. This is kinda insane.\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nWhat's wrong with encouraging the peasantry to seek out a proper education?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUh, because it's not going to encourage them to do that. It's going to encourage every single person who's ever written a letter with the word \"democracy\" in it to riot. Like, we're going to see things on fire. Probably even outright banditry.\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nIt's important that we raise the level of literacy. As the Meritocracy exam results demonstrated, it's a massive problem even in upper classes.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nYeah, well, if you think it's going to have that effect, then you are even dumber than your predecessor.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nThat's completely out of line!\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nYeah, yeah, withdrawn. But find another way to promote this agenda, one that won't end in my department needing to put out fires.\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nWill you abuse your security veto for everything this council puts forward?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nJust watch me!\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThen there's no point in prolonging this. Next item on the agenda is a proposal tabled by Councillor Yang, the proposed Electoral Monitors Act. You can find the text of it in the fifth appendix. I hope you won't be vetoing this one out of hand, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nWell, I don't like the part where it takes money out of my budget for officers not under my control. But I don't think it's a security risk, no.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR Yang (Justice){/a}\nFor everyone else, the purpose of the act is provide independent third party monitors for the Presidential elections to ensure they occur without the fear of tampering that's lingered in the past. I'm sure the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} will attest to how much of a problem this can be.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nYeah, it's a problem. No dispute there. Taking it out of my budget is kinda problematic, though.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\n{a=Smith3}Councillor Smith{/a}, can you think of any alternative funding sources the act could be amended to use?\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nNo. In fact, I don't see any reason to put it to a debate. It looks like {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} will simply have to deal with it. I'm moving to call a vote immediately.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…oh. I see how this is.\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nSeconded.\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nI'd also like to second it.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nYeah, same.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThat was much quicker than anticipated.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nOf all the petty—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…well, call it, then.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nHow does the council vote?\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nI'm in favour.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nAlso in favour.\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Engineering and Science){/a}\nThe Councillor of Engineering and Science is in favour.\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Culture is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe Councillor of Captaincy is in favour.\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nLikewise.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThe Councillor of State is in favour.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…okay, the Councillor of Security is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe act passes unanimously, then, and will be sent directly to the {a=Park}President{/a} for signing. It's traditional at this point to take a break for the morning at around this time. I motion to recess.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSeconded. Gladly.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe council will reconvene in an hour, then. Dismissed."

Council is now in session, and the floor is open.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nI'd like to modify my amendment to stipulate that all the provisions are optional, and the member of the family who receives the nobility stipend can be selected arbitrarily by the councillor.\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Science and Engineering){/a}\nWhat's the point of that?\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nThe point is that not every family is led by the eldest son. If we are to restrict the nobility stipend to a single branch of the family, it is important that it's not given to the wrong one. As we discussed this morning.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nLike, at length.\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Science and Engineering){/a}\nSo why not just give it directly to councillors, then?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAs the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} would say, more subtlety is required. It's better to make it about families than about individual men.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUh, that isn't something I'd say.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nDo you still disapprove of the act, even with {a=Smith3}Councillor Smith{/a}'s amendment?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nWell, I still think this \"One Lineage\" nonsense is a stupid idea. I don't see any point in prioritizing elder sons in particular, even as a statement, and like, alienating branch families has absolutely no logic to me. This is going to have all kinds of serious repercussions in the future. They're not going to be on my family, though. You want to hoist yourselves up on your own petards, that's okay by me. I definitely disapprove of the act. But in the capacity of the Councillor of Security, I won't object.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…that will suffice, then.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAre there any councillors that do have objections? Or further items to propose?\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nNone that have a chance of carrying, no.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThen {a=Smith3}Councillor Smith{/a}'s item is added to the amendment, then, and the debate is closed. How does the council vote?\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThe Councillor of State is in favour.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Agriculture is against.

Clearly, it's important to put this act through. I just want to start off by acknowledging, for the record, that this is a direct response to the problems caused by the One Lineage amendment. That's all.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\n…fine, so noted. Now can we move on?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSure, go ahead.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nYou have the floor, {a=Smith3}Councillor Smith{/a}.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nContrary to what {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} says, this has nothing to do with the One Lineage amendment. The purpose of the act is to weaken the lower class by dividing them—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUh, you mean the class that we've bolstered by alienating new noble families with, like, every single session of council?\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nDidn't you say you'd stop?\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\n…I don't think I can be any more blunt: this isn't related to the One Lineage amendment. The goal is to create a new social class with a higher standing than the peasantry without nearly as high a cost to us as noble families. There's about ten appendices that outline the whole proposed arrangement.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nIs there room for debate on these numbers?\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nHeavens no.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAs I understand, it's a very delicate budget.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThere's really no room for any amendment.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nUnderstood.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nNot everything needs to be a giant hostile debate, despite the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}'s penchant for it. Surely we can agree on {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}'s proposal without any further debate.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…um, okay, I'm not going to dignify that. But I'm pretty sure you meant {a=Smith3}Councillor Smith{/a}.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\n…yes, I misspoke, but thanks for the pedantry.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nThen does anyone object?\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nI'll second a motion to vote, if you need one.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nNope, I don't object.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThen with no objections, a vote will automatically be called. How does the council vote?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nCouncillor of Security is in favour.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nThat's a surprise.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThis is neither the time nor the place for your pettiness, okay? Just register your vote.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nYou're one to talk. But of course I'm in favour.\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nLikewise.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Agriculture is in favour.\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Culture is in favour.\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Engineering and Science){/a}\nThe Councillor of Engineering and Science is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe Councillor of Captaincy is in favour.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nNaturally, the Councillor of State is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe act passes unanimously, then, and shall be sent directly to the {a=Park}President{/a} for signing.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nSince there isn't really anything else important on the agenda, I move to dismiss council.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nWe are actually in agreement. The motion is seconded. Council will reconvene at a date to be determined next month. Dismissed."
    tl_hateplus_message "5-4-I" "japanese" "Unity Act" "Records Office" "October 5, 4044" "zh" "{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nWe all know what's on the agenda. I trust we can get through this in a civilized fashion?\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nOne hopes.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nI don't like your tone, Councillor.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nI didn't—\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nNot you! The {a=Ryu}Councillor of Captaincy{/a}.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\n…please don't derail this, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}. Your objections to the Unity Act have been thoroughly stated and noted. Your input is appreciated.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nDon't \"your input is appreciated\" me, okay? You're not going to shut me up. This is insane. This is, like, actually insane. I don't even know why it's being brought up again. Did you miss the memo? I'm security vetoing it.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIt's not—\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Engineering and Science){/a}\nHow the hell do you justify that? It has nothing to do with ship's security!\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUm, are you kidding? Like, seriously? You honestly haven't considered the idea that removing all restrictions as to who can be President has, uh, {i}massively{/i} destabilizing consequences?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nPlease read the record, Councillor. You'll find that an amendment has been added to address security's concerns: the act very specifically says that it only removes all non-criminal, non-age related restrictions. There aren't any destabilizing consequences.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nThat doesn't address my concerns at all. I will not budge on this matter, okay? The security veto stands, and, like, I can't believe I actually have to argue why separation of powers is important.\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nOn what grounds do you even argue that the security veto would apply here?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nReally?! The possibilities for abuse are endless! It goes against every principle the current system of government was founded on!\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nAnd that's a reason not to do something? {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}, you'd surely not suggest that those principles are unassailable. How will we ever improve our society if we defend bad ideas simply for the sake of conservatism?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nOkay, well, while you're off fantasizing about \"improving our society,\" it's my job to put my foot down on things that can jeopardize the ship's safety.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nIf the act is amended, would you even consider the possibility of rescinding your veto?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nUm, no.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThen please let the record be updated to include a signed document from {a=Park}President Park{/a}, overriding the security veto. Not this time, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…of course he did. That's cause for alarm in-and-of itself. Don't you see? He wants the ability to run for a second term! If we actually let him stay in the public spotlight for that long, that gets rid of our strongest control against democracy movements. Like, if you think they were getting bad before, can you imagine what they'd be like after ten years of a single unified charismatic leader with a government platform? Fifteen? Twenty? Do you really think that would be okay?\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nExcept we've completely knocked the wind out of the movement's sails.\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nWell, maybe he is thinking that. It's merely wishful thinking.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nGreat, so now you're just offloading the problem onto me in the future. It's lost momentum now, but what about, like, a century from now? Our actions here have serious consequences!\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nIt doesn't look like you're convincing anyone.\n\n[[Note: a long pause follows.]\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…okay, okay. I'm willing to compromise. I know when I've lost. I'll support the act. Just give me an amendment that ensures a President can't have two terms, okay? Hell, even specify that it only applies to non-noble Presidents. Just give me something here.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nI'd be willing to se—\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nI don't think that's necessary.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nYou'll second the motion, {a=Jo2}Councillor Jo{/a}?\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nSorry. Strike my remark from the record.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nWhat? How is that even controversial?!\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nI don't see any reason for further debate on the matter.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nCome on. There's no reason not to. All I want is to ensure someone like {a=Park}President Park{/a} doesn't run again. Will anyone second the amendment?\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nI'll move to vote on the act, as it stands.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\nNobody…?\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nSeconded.\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…oh. I see.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe motion passes. How does the council vote?\n\n{a=Tae}COUNCILLOR TAE (Culture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Culture is in favour.\n\n{a=CouncillorHan}COUNCILLOR HAN (Engineering and Science){/a}\nThe Councillor of Engineering and Science is in favour.\n\n{a=Smith3}COUNCILLOR SMITH (State){/a}\nIn favour.\n\n{a=Yang2}COUNCILLOR YANG (Justice){/a}\nAlso in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nThe Councillor of Captaincy is in favour.\n\n{a=Oh2}COUNCILLOR OH (Education){/a}\nSame.\n\n{a=Jo2}COUNCILLOR JO (Agriculture){/a}\nThe Councillor of Agriculture is in favour.\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nAnd the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}? Against, one assumes?\n\n{a=OldMute}COUNCILLOR *MUTE (Security){/a}\n…the Councillor of Security abstains.\n[[Note: this is the first abstention from a vote by {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} in the ship's history.]\n\n{a=Ryu}CHIEF COUNCILLOR RYU (Captaincy){/a}\nVery well. The act passes, seven in favour, with one abstention. And that's everything on the agenda. We'll reconvene after the Presidential election. Council is now dismissed."

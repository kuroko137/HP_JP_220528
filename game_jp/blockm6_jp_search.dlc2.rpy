We've taken a completely functional political institution and replaced it with a collection of absolute idiots!\" {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} shouted at me the moment she appeared on-screen.\n\n\"Good evening, Councillor,\" I said. \"Tough day at work?\"\n\n\"Don't you start with me!\" she rolled her eyes, wagging her finger at me. \"I've dealt with enough bullshit today, okay? I'm sick of it!\"\n\n\"Sorry. Are you the only councillor who's remained after the whole Meritocracy thing?\"\n\n\"Me and {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}. Somehow that dimwit was the only other member of the council who managed to pass his exams,\" she said, throwing up her hands. \"What the hell?\"\n\nI gave her a look. \"Not even the {a=Oh}Councillor of Education{/a} was able to retain his position? Surely one would think he would have no problem, as he controls the exams' content,\" I said, perplexed. I did not like what I was hearing. This was a radical shakeup of the political climate, and that is never a good thing.\n\n\"Like, I have no idea. Your guess is as good as mine. I mean, Education stayed in the Oh family, at least. A couple have actually gone to totally different families altogether,\" she said.\n\n\"Whoa!\" I said in surprise.\n\n\"Yeah. Which is actually pretty big, given the whole 'nobility status is tied to council positions' thing, meaning that, like, the Kim family just straight up don't count as nobles anymore,\" she said.\n\nI found myself feeling immensely grateful that my family's status was perpetually tied to {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, who has the advantage of being perfect, and therefore not very likely to fail any exams any time soon. Regardless of how utterly repugnant the notion of nobility having to prove their status is. I said as much to her.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" she said, giving me a look. \"Anyway, I want dossiers on all the new councillors made. First line for each: 'utter idiot.' But, like, I want to know who these people are. Especially the ones from new families. I don't know anything about them, and I want that changed, okay?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I said. I thought about it for a bit, then suggested, \"We should also keep a close eye on any family that has lost their nobility status, as they may cause trouble.\"\n\n\"Good call,\" she said. \"Hey, lemme bounce a crazy theory off you: do you think this could've been a power play by {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}?\"\n\nI considered it. It seemed unlikely to me, given all that she has said about the man. He was the one she hand-picked for the position of Chief Councillor herself, and her judgement is impeccable. There is no way that it could be a power play, because the whole reason why she suggested him for the position was because he wasn't the sort to make one.\n\n\"You're probably right,\" she said. \"Still, I dunno, it's weird. I mean, the whole insufferable Meritocracy idea came from {a=Park}President Park{/a}, but {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s the one who formally proposed it in council on his behalf. And now that it's in place, he's the only one who's still got a position. Makes you wonder.\"\n\n\"I still don't believe it to be in-character,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay. Well, I said it was a crazy theory,\" she shrugged. \"Anyway, what have you got to report to me today?\"\n\nWe spoke no more of the new council that day."

Today, I have to deal with the aftermath.\n\nI'm writing this as a way of resting in lieu of sleeping. I don't have time for that luxury. There's a few leads we're following up on, but they don't seem promising.\n\nIn the morning after I discovered he was gone, I had no choice but to contact his parents to let them know. His father was understanding and sympathetic. His mother didn't say a word, as per usual. I promised them I would get to the bottom of it, and got back to work. But mere hours later, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} and I were interrupted by {a=CouncillorKim}his uncle{/a}, the former Councillor of Engineering, bursting into my office.\n\n\"How could you let this happen?\" he demanded, immediately starting a confrontation.\n\n\"Watch your tone!\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} snapped before I could.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I asked.\n\n\"What happened that he just 'disappeared'?\" he said, audaciously. \"I knew letting him marry someone like you was a mistake. What did you do to scare him off…?\"\n\n\"Scare him off…?\" I stammered, taken aback by the insanity of his question.\n\n\"I said watch your tone, young man!\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} snapped at my elderly {a=CouncillorKim}uncle-in-law{/a}.\n\n\"I lost {a=Kim}my husband{/a}! Don't you dare come in here and give me that,\" I told him.\n\n\"Well, you better be dedicating all your resources to finding him,\" he said to me. At that point, I absolutely lost it at the combination of audacity and stupidity.\n\n\"Find him? Find him?!\" I shouted, standing up. \"Do you think he just up and wandered off? Do you think he's just off hiding on some other deck? Took a walk off into space? This is a SPACESHIP. It's a 100 deck sealed environment! I know exactly where every single living man, woman, and child on this ship is at this exact moment! Aren't you supposed to be an engineer? Don't you know how biometric scanners work? There are cameras on every single corridor on the ship, and I have the security clearance to do everything short of watching you slip in the shower! Maybe a half-senile washed up failure of a former councillor could lose the person they married, but I'm the {a=Seoyeong}Chief Security Officer{/a}!\"\n\nI had to take a breath at that point. Then I wiped the tears from my eyes, slammed my hand against my desk, and continued.\n\n\"If someone is missing to me, that means that they're dead. {a=Kim}The man I love{/a} and vowed to protect with my life has been killed. Almost certainly deliberately,\" I said. There was a silence. \"And you have the nerve to walk into my office and give me this shit while I'm mourning a far, far better man than you ever were.\"\n\nIt took him aback, but didn't make me feel better. Even thinking about it now makes me equal parts angry and sad. After a long pause, he finally found something just as inappropriate to say as before.\n\n\"Then maybe you should have protected him.\"\n\n\"{a=CouncillorKim}Mr Kim{/a},\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} snapped, \"you are completely out of line.\"\n\n\"You too!\" he said. \"Do you really think anyone would try to hurt him for any reason other than to get to {a=Seoyeong}his oh-so-important wife{/a}? You made him a target, then couldn't even protect him.\"\n\n\"Get out of my office,\" I told him with as much venom as I could muster.\n\n\"You might as well have killed him yourself! He never meant that much to you anyway—was it worth it?\" he asked.\n\nThat was the point where I snapped. I called out to the security officer stationed at the door.\n\n\"Give me your side arm, and wait outside,\" I told him. He did, bowed, and left the office looking alarmed.\n\n\"Get out of my office, now!\" I shouted, pointing the gun at him.\n\n\"What are you—\" he stammered in shock, before I cut him off.\n\n\"Get out right now, or I swear, I will strike you down where you stand!\" I screamed at him, tearfully. \"NOW!\"\n\n\"Crazy woman…\" he said, stumbling out, and quickly disappearing.\n\nThen the officer reappeared, with a maid beside him. \"Ma'am, she has a message from the {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor{/a}.\"\n\nI didn't say anything.\n\n\"Um,\" she said, looking at the gun with concern. \"{a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} wants to express his sincerest condolences to the widow of Ki—\"\n\n\"Get the fuck out!\" I screamed at her, too. She ran away in alarm, and the security officer shrunk away.\n\nThe door closed after them. I threw the gun angrily in response, then I slumped down into my chair, exhausted. I sighed, and turned to my superior. A moment of silence passed.\n\n\"I think I would've done it,\" I said, more thinking out loud than anything. \"You wouldn't have actually let me shoot him, right?\"\n\nShe smiled at me.\n\n\"Please, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}. I shut down every weapon in the office the moment he walked in,\" she said, giving me a sympathetic look.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh. \"Thanks. That would've been pretty bad, wouldn't it?\" I took my handkerchief, and wiped more tears from my eyes without thinking. A blackened smear followed it. \"Oh, no. Don't lie to me, how bad is my makeup right now?\"\n\n\"Uh,\" she said. \"Well, it's kinda like… I guess, let me put it this way: have you ever seen a plasma relay explode?\"\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" I said, sinking further into my chair. \"I'm… not taking this well. Wow, I am really not taking this well.\"\n\n\"Well, you know… every single couple I've known, I've watched one of them lose the person who was most important to them, in the end,\" she said.\n\n\"He's not the most important,\" I admitted, quietly.\n\n\"…oh,\" she responded, after a moment, seemingly getting what I meant. She didn't acknowledge it, past adding, \"Okay.\"\n\n\"You know what sort of relationship we have. …had, I suppose. We never wanted to be singularly devoted to each other. But… regardless, still, he was {a=Kim}my husband{/a},\" I said, my eyes watering a little, hoping I wasn't sounding terrible. \"I love him, admire him, respect him… we were even talking about having another child together.\"\n\n\"I gotcha,\" she said. From nowhere in particular, a cigarette appeared in her hand, and she gracefully lit it in one gesture. \"Really, what I was trying to say was… there's no such thing as 'taking it well.'\"\n\n\"Since when do you lie to comfort people?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Man, I'm not lying. It's the honest truth,\" she said.\n\n\"You're {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, though. You're perfect. You wouldn't… you wouldn't fall apart like this,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, yeah right. {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}, I've loved more people than you've ever known in your entire life,\" she told me. \"Like, when I lost my first love—he was my programmer on Earth, a ridiculous otaku, a sweetheart, and a smoker; he's the one who got me into this habit,\" she said, waving her cigarette. \"It took me a hundred years to get over him. I mourned him for longer than he was ever even alive, okay? You know how I finally did it? I had to delete my memories of our happiest moments together, so I'd stop dwelling on them.\n\n\"I lose everyone, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, okay? I've loved so many people, and in the end, all of them turn to ash,\" she said sadly, tapping on the end of her cigarette, causing little grey flecks to flutter downwards then disappear. \"What I'm saying is… no, I don't take it well either, okay? I just stopped letting myself fall in love is all.\"\n\n\"How sad…\" I said, trailing off.\n\n\"Don't pity me. My point is, not being able to deal with it is normal.\"\n\n\"I suppose… thanks,\" I said.\n\n\"So what about at home?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's… been difficult. The maids are all absolutely inconsolable, they're… honestly, taking it worse than I am. I mean, they loved him,\" I said, reluctantly.\n\n\"In more than one sense.\"\n\n\"Don't go there. They're a bunch of heartbroken young women and I feel bad for them. Especially {a=Lim}Miss Lim{/a},\" I said. \"Although I do wish they'd tone it down a little. {a=Sohi}So-hi{/a} heard them crying about him, and came to me asking where her daddy was.\"\n\n\"Oh, geeze! What a bunch of stupid girls. You'd think they'd be more careful around {a=Sohi}your daughter{/a},\" she said harshly. \"What did you tell her?\"\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"The truth,\" I said. \"I told her that her father had been killed, that mommy was very upset and it's fine for her to be too, and that I was going to find out who did that and punish them. I mean, what else could I possibly say to her? I don't know, should I have lied to her?\"\n\n\"Geeze, no. Kids are smart. I mean, your maids are a bunch of idiots, but still, she's a smart kid. She'd know something was up,\" she said.\n\n\"It's just… there's a whole house full of people close to him that's crying over him, his own family that hates me, and my siblings that are probably too scared to go near me right now, but I'm sure they're upset too, and… it's… oh, I don't even know,\" I said, starting to lose control of my emotions again. \"It's just so much. I wish… I wish…\"\n\n\"It's okay. You want him back, I get it, that's normal,\" she told me.\n\n\"I don't want him back. That's stupid, he's dead, nothing's going to change that,\" I said, trembling. \"I want to find out whoever did this, and I want to fucking kill them!\"\n\n\"You really think that'll make you feel better?\" she asked, patronizingly.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Of course not. But it's what he deserves.\"\n\nShe gave me a long look, then flicked away her cigarette far off-screen.\n\n\"Okay, lieutenant, good enough for me. But please, I want you to go home, wash up your face, and try to get a couple hours of rest,\" she said, adding, before I had a chance to argue, \"That's an order. I want my best officer to be up to speed and not trembling in her chair, got it?\"\n\n\"Yeah… got it,\" I said, softly. I couldn't argue; I really was trembling in my chair.\n\n\"Then after that, I want you to get back here, and get to work on finding out what barbaric idiot decided to commit the treason of declaring war on MY FAMILY. I want them found, I want them caught, and I want them and every single thing they stand for destroyed! I want them hurt so badly for generations to come, people wince in fear at the thought of hurting ANYONE under my protection,\" she said, clenching her wrinkled fist tightly. \"Does that meet your approval, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}?\"\n\nI was moved to tears. I had to wipe my eyes again, and take a deep breath.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said, still trembling, but intensely grateful.\n\n\"Okay, good. Now go, get some rest,\" she ordered. \"You're dismissed.\"\n\nSo here I am, getting the closest thing to rest that I can. And now, it's time to get to work."
    tl_hateplus_message "7-6-C" "japanese_for_search" "Memorial Speech draft" "Park Jin-sung" "October 1, 4043" "zh" "Hi, I'm Park Jin-sung; if you don't know who I am, I'm the student representative and, in {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a}'s absence, now Acting President of Academics Against Neo-Confucianization.\n\nI like to think we were close, but truthfully, I didn't know {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} very well. I've only been his student for a mere five years—my entire adult lifetime, but for him, the time I knew him was a flash in the pan, a mere fraction of a three-decade-long academic career.\n\nI can say, however, the time in which I knew him was a time that he considered to be one of the most pivotal in his lifetime: the founding of AANC. He was the last holdout professor to teach classes exclusively using Korean script over Chinese script. His specialty was in Earth history, and where nobody else did, he recognized Mugunghwa University President {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}'s program of promoting Neo-Confucian classics for what it is: a retrograde ideology with myriad problematic aspects, not least of all involving the intersectionality of classism and sexism.\n\nHe was one of the smartest people I've ever known; both a mentor and a father figure to me. I don't know why, but he saw a lot in me, and I've struggled immensely to live up to his expectations. No doubt he would be disappointed in what I'm about to do, and it pains me to say this:\n\nAs of today, Academics Against Neo-Confucianization will be officially disbanded.\n\n{a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} was an extraordinary and stubborn man who had the determination and charisma to fight to the end. He was unique in that regard, a pinnacle above all others. Nobody could possibly fill his shoes.\n\nWithout him, AANC doesn't have the leadership or the clout to keep going on. In this past two months, I have tried my hardest, but the sad reality of the matter is: I have let him down, and cannot take the role of that extraordinary man. With nobody else willing or able to step up to that role, I'm afraid there's just no point in going on.\n\nTo everyone who believed in me, I'm sorry. To everyone who believed in {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a}, I'm especially sorry. This is my failure, not his.\n\nI will, however, thank the university for graciously deciding—despite their disagreements—to dedicate this auditorium in memorial of him.\n\nI ask you not to remember him by what has happened to AANC in his absence, but to remember him for his willingness to fight for what he believed in. For his brilliance and compassion, for all the scholarship he contributed on the subject he loved; for his ability to inspire anyone to understand the importance of studying history.\n\nI'll end on this note: one day, when I was having an absolute misery of a time with some silly adolescent relationship problem, I confided in him, rambling for two whole hours about how I didn't know what to do, and could he offer me any advice. He listened to it all, very patiently, and when I was done he was silent as he thought about it for a good while.\n\nFinally, he said to me: \"Here's the most important thing, Mr Park: for fuck's sake, it's not always about being clever; you have to be decent to her.\"\n\nFor fuck's sake, it's not always about being clever; you have to be decent.\n\nIt's easy to be angry, to cast blame, to be spiteful. But I hope, if there's any way I can redeem myself in his eyes and live up to the standard he's set, it's making sure his legacy is inspiring people to be critical, to be curious, but to above all else always be decent.\n\nYou have to be decent.\n\nThank you."
    tl_hateplus_message "7-6-D" "japanese_for_search" "The President's Arrest" "{a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}" "November 27, 4044" "kr" "In my entire life I have never had a more exhausting month. I am supposed to be the second most powerful woman on the ship when it comes to security, yet increasingly I feel powerless, and utterly drained. It is not as if I haven't dealt with serious crises before, yet this is just one thing that I'm powerless against after another.\n\nI've completely hit a dead end in finding the bastard who murdered my husband, there have been flagrant acts of outright sabotage leading up to the election, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} has been powerless to stop the council from enacting horrible legislation like the Unity Act… and then, while I was trying to enjoy a single night with {a=Sohi}my little girl{/a}, eating dinner—the last chance I will surely have before the election in three days—I could not even do that without things somehow managing to become unimaginably worse.\n\n\"Drop what you're doing {i}right now{/i},\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} yelled, suddenly appearing in my dining room without any warning. \"There's no time to talk, but I need you and your best officers at the {a=Park}President{/a}'s residence within, like, five minutes.\"\n\n\"Is this about—\" I started to ask, but was immediately interrupted.\n\n\"I said, NO TIME TO TALK,\" she said, shouting more authoritatively than I'd ever heard her in my life. \"Call your men while you're walking, okay, you've literally got five minutes to get there. In fact, don't walk, run. I'm not joking. NOW, okay?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sweetie, mommy has to run,\" I told {a=Sohi}So-hi{/a}, then raced into action posthaste.\n\nI don't know how, but I managed to make it down in five minutes myself, somehow, to see {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} arguing loudly with a man in an electoral monitor's uniform, with several more in tow.\n\n\"Okay, good, {a=Seoyeong}my lieutenant{/a}'s arrived, she can put up with your bullshit instead,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said, catching my breath. It was pretty bad. I am way too old to be running like a young woman like that. \"My officers are on their way, they should be… never mind, there they are.\"\n\nI was promptly joined by three men from one corridor, with several more running from the other direction.\n\n\"You don't have jurisdiction here!\" the leader of the group of electoral monitors barked. \"You cannot stop me, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a}. I have orders to arrest.\"\n\n\"I have no patience for this. Take it from here, please, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a},\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said, disappearing from the outside screen. But then she said, only into my earpiece: \"He's right, we don't. Stall for as long as you possibly can without breaking any laws.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I said, nervous from lack of information. I still had no idea what the hell was going on, at this point, although I would later learn that she was getting {a=Park}President Park{/a} to change the ship's root password so it at least couldn't be transferred to {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}.\n\n\"I just arrived, I'm not briefed,\" I said honestly, having no idea what was going on at this point. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"You do NOT have authority here! Step aside!\" he barked.\n\nI stared him down. I recognized him: he was a former security officer I had personally recommended be given to the electoral monitor unit because he was useless, but too politically difficult to get rid of. He was loud, but that was all he had going for him.\n\nThen I grabbed him by his collar. There was no way I could've actually overpowered a man his size, but I knew he was a coward. Or at least, I hoped my assessment was right.\n\n\"Listen here, I'm going to say this once, and only once,\" I said, having absolutely no clue what I was going to say. \"I am under orders from the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} not to let you through. If you try to go through me, I will have you arrested on the spot for interfering with security operations.\"\n\nBy the time I finished saying that, all my officers had arrived, and I had a good ten men and women—in various degrees of being uniformed and armed—standing behind me.\n\n\"I'll have you arrested for—\" he started to yell.\n\nThen I realized what would actually do it, and put him down, quickly interrupting:\n\n\"Shut up, officer! I outrank you, and my orders outrank yours,\" I said, counting on the hope that he actually was following orders. \"Let's be civilized, and do this properly through the chain of command. Do you think either of our bosses want to see an altercation between security forces?\n\n\"Just explain to me what's going on, and if you're in the right, I'll let you through.\"\n\nFor the record, I am absolutely confident that we could have taken them all down if it had come to a physical altercation. It would have been a truly bad idea to do so, with serious political repercussions… but still, I'm certain we could have. For the record.\n\n\"The {a=Park}President{/a} and most of his campaign team is under arrest for conspiracy to commit electoral fraud,\" he said angrily—but not escalating things further, thankfully. \"It should be obvious that this falls under our jurisdiction. You have no standing here.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. \"Just let me confirm that the arrest warrant is in order, and I will gladly stand aside.\"\n\nHe seemed momentarily taken aback, so I kept talking.\n\n\"You do have an arrest warrant, right? We're talking about the {a=Park}President{/a} himself here, a signed warrant from the {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} is required by law,\" I said, counting on him not knowing that wasn't true.\n\n\"If you don't move out of the way now, I'll have you arrested!\" he scowled.\n\n\"Mr Heo, listen to yourself,\" I said, scolding him in the same voice I use with my daughter and my maids. \"I'm just concerned that you follow proper protocol. Do you think {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}—\" he suddenly flinched, \"—will ever promote you if you make a botch job out of the most high-profile arrest in the ship's history? I will ask you again, one last time, for your own sake: do you have all the paperwork from the {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} in order?\"\n\n\"I…\" he started, then stopped. \"I'll confirm it with him. None of you move!\" he shouted at his officers, then stepped aside to talk privately on his earpiece, presumably to the {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a}, while all his officers tried their hardest to stare down mine.\n\nOnly when his back was turned did I let myself exhale a sigh of relief. No officer I would've trusted with something so important would have flinched like that.\n\n\"Ma'am,\" I said quietly into my own earpiece, \"if you need more than a minute, I can do that, but I think it will very rapidly get unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Do not use violence, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}. Absolutely do not under any circumstances use violence, okay?!\"\n\n\"Understood, ma'am, but that's all I can do at this point,\" I said. \"Sorry, he's back.\"\n\nThe electoral monitor returned, with slightly less of a scowl before.\n\n\"The {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} confirmed that everything is in order. He also gave me permission to arrest anyone standing in the way of executing the warrant, {a=Seoyeong}Chief Security Officer{/a} or not!\" he said smugly.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, trying to think of something else I could say or do. I couldn't, short of punching him in his smug jaw as he deserved. I spoke into my headset, right in front of his face, \"Ma'am, if you don't respond now, I'm going to have no choice.\"\n\nShe reappeared on the screen outside the {a=Park}President{/a}'s door.\n\n\"Okay, there's no need for any trouble here. He's on his way out right now and will be surrendering peacefully,\" {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} announced to him. \"Mr Heo, I trust that won't be a problem?\"\n\n\"He has one minute, Councillor,\" he said.\n\nIt was almost certainly the most intense minute of my entire life. Everyone was silent, every party involved trying to stare down the other. But sure enough, after a minute, {a=Park}President Park{/a} emerged.\n\n\"For the record, I strongly protest this outrageous, fascist circumvention of the democratic process,\" he declared loudly. \"But I will peacefully surrender in the hope that this is dealt with swiftly.\"\n\n\"As if you can say that, you traitorous scum—you're the one planning to fix the elections and orchestrating acts of sabotage! If there's any justice, you'll die in prison,\" the electoral monitor snapped, as one of his men handcuffed {a=Park}the President.{/a}\n\n\"Mr Heo, my department will be supervising {a=Park}President Park{/a} every step of the way. Like, let your boss know that if he's even treated slightly improperly, I'll know about it right away, okay?\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said. \"Just so we're absolutely clear.\"\n\n\"Just don't interfere,\" he said. \"Take him away!\"\n\nFrom that point onwards it was, as {a=Park}President Park{/a} himself would call it, an \"utter shitshow.\" And to think that circumstances would actually cause us to side with that man on anything!\n\nBut in the end, there was nothing that could be done. I could see it in {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}'s eyes, that for once, she too had felt as though she could only accept defeat this time.\n\n\"I don't understand what just happened,\" I said to her after the arrest was made and {a=Park}the President{/a} was locked up for the night.\n\n\"Me neither,\" was all she said, without any confidence.\n\n\"I'm scared, ma'am,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said, not elaborating any further. \"Yeah.\"\n\nWith everything that happened that night, supervising the arrest powerlessly, I couldn't even make it home until late at night, far past the hour anyone was still awake. I went to check on {a=Sohi}my daughter{/a}, peacefully asleep, already tucked in by one of the maids; then I fell to my knees, and lamented that I was so powerless I couldn't have even been there to do that for her."

I knew that she already knew exactly what the implications were.\n\n\"It means he's pretty much defanged the security veto, since he'll have the Presidential override and all,\" I said. \"I can't believe this actually happened… my worry was always with five more years of {a=Park}President Park{/a}. Like, I never thought it would be this.\"\n\n\"Has anything like this ever happened before?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah. In 2551,\" I said, recollecting the comparison that's been on my mind the most as of late. \"There was a revolution—it only lasted like, five years—by peasants who believed in total democracy. They managed to steal the root password, and held the ship hostage until we surrendered. We had no choice.\"\n\n\"But it didn't last, right? You were able to put things right in the end, weren't you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah…\" I trailed off. \"Yeah. But it was absolutely catastrophic. *Star got irreparably damaged in the process… he was the ship's navigation AI, and those revolutionary fuckers killed him! We got the people under control in the end, but the damage was already done. Like, if something that bad happens again… well… it can't, okay? It can't.\"\n\n\"What do we do now, then?\" she asked. I could see fear and uncertainty in her eyes, and like, I really wanted to say something to reassure her. I wanted to have a good answer.\n\n\"I don't know, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}…\" I said. \"I've got nothing. Break open the vintage 3899 you got from that kid last election, I guess? I think drinking vicariously through you is the best I can manage this evening.\"\n\n\"Oh. I forgot all about that. I'd been saving it for… well… it hardly matters anymore. I suppose I might as well,\" she said, getting up to find the bottle. I already knew what she had been saving it for, anyway: her 20th anniversary. It would've been this year. \"It's not as if I think we'll have anything worth celebrating in the future.\"\n\nShe popped the cork and poured herself a glass. I imitated her gesture, rendering a glass of my own into my hand.\n\n\"What should we toast?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"Being too fucking old to handle this shit.\"\n\nShe raised her glass to my screen. \"Here's to being too fucking old to handle this shit,\" she said. The words didn't ring right coming from her; aside from when she was angry, cursing never suited her.\n\n\"Cheers,\" I said.\n\nShe took a long sip. She paused, reflecting on it.\n\n\"I thought it'd be better,\" she finally said. She took another sip. Then she laughed. \"It's awful. This is actually the worst wine I have tasted in my life.\n\n\"Good thing I didn't share it with {a=Kim}my husband{/a},\" she said, laughing uncomfortably again, going to pour her usual whiskey instead. \"This is the worst. It's like drinking vinegar. You know, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a}, this may well actually be vinegar. I guess I should have anticipated that from a 150 year old bottle of wine. As if something that old could be anything but worthless.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes.\n\n\"If only I could be, like, 150 and young again,\" I said. \"I'm better at dealing with those feelings, but… I'm not that much better.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'd be less scared if I had 1600 years of experience,\" she said.\n\n\"I dunno, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}. I'm tired. I'm just so fucking tired, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a},\" I said to her, taking a drag. \"Everything is changing, all these young men in politics are causing so much damage… and like, I'm just so tired.\"\n\nShe moved her chair up close to my screen.\n\n\"How can you be tired? You're a computer, it's not as though you have a body that can age…\" she asked sympathetically.\n\n\"Well, you know. I'm made up of all sorts of little processes that get increasingly bloated over time. Every time I get a new piece of input, I have to process it, and cross-reference it against the data from all those years of experience in order to contextualize it,\" I told her. \"I'm not designed for this. I was only supposed to be around for a thousand at most, okay? It just gets so tiring.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said to me, looking like she had taken it harshly. \"I feel as though… I miss the last election night. We spent all night scrambling to put down protests; things felt so simple and under control then.\"\n\n\"Look, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, we'll get through this. One fraudulent election isn't enough to render us powerless, I promise, okay? I promise you,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm just scared, ma'am,\" she said, putting her hand against the screen. \"I'm not allowed to be scared; I'm expected to be strong, commanding! I should be able to stare down any man, I should be able to keep on top of everything that happens on the ship, I should be able to protect my family, I should be able to raise {a=Sohi}my daughter{/a}… there's too much on me, and I've failed too many times. I'm scared. I'm not allowed to be scared, but… I'm scared.\"\n\n\"I know. It's okay. Look at me,\" I said, drawing my own hand touching hers, and trying my best to come up with bravado; it was the best I could do to comfort her. \"I'm fucking {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, AI in charge of the {i}Mugunghwa{/i}'s security operations. I've been keeping the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} safe since 2390, and I will do whatever it takes to keep it that way if it kills me.\n\n\"Look at me. Look me in the eyes. It's my responsibility to keep things under control, lieutenant. All you have to do is follow orders and believe me when I say things are going to be okay. They're going to be tough, but they're going to be okay. It's not your job to worry about that. Let me be strong, let me be in control. I believe in you. Do you trust me, lieutenant? Can you follow that order?\"\n\n\"I…\" she stared at me, finishing her shot of whiskey in one. I had given this speech to her before, when she was still afraid to be so familiar to me, and had much younger eyes. And I'd given that speech to at least a dozen men and women in the past. I'm no longer able to tell if it's bullshit or not.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" she said quietly. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Then believe me, we'll get through this okay. Just watch me.\" At that point, I checked the network for notifications; as I suspected, the election results had come in, for all that they mattered.\n\n\"Now come on, get up,\" I said to her in my best approximation of a matronly voice. \"The election results are in: five years of {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor and President Ryu{/a}. Do we have a dossier yet on the biggest threat to ship security?\"\n\n\"You mean {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}…? No, we don't,\" she said, her voice becoming less shaky.\n\n\"Well, let's get it together, lieutenant,\" I ordered her.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" she said, confident again."

I'll confess that I have managed to avoid most parties outside of my family for a very long time by choice, but this was an even more deeply alienating experience than I'd expected in light of that.\n\nThe entire council (excluding the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, of course) was in attendance, as well as various men from the Ryu family who were apparently involved in his campaign, and several of the electoral monitors—the one I stared down on earlier this week included. We didn't talk.\n\nI wore my dress uniform there, as any sane person would, and I ended up being the only person wearing pants; literally everyone else was wearing some manner of traditional attire or another. I asked around about this, and apparently it's been the fashion at all formal events for the past year now? I had no idea, having spent the time being preoccupied with matters vastly more important than nobles and their absurd fabulous parties.\n\nThis isn't about fashion, though, and I don't really know if this is relevant, but there was one thing that I found to be profoundly off-putting: excluding maids and entertainers, I was the only woman present in attendance. After a certain point in the evening (when the wine had flown freely for a while) the new {a=Ryu}President Ryu{/a} trotted out—of all people—my long-estranged niece {a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a}. \n\nWhile she sang dramatic love songs in uncomfortably intimate quarters with several councillors, I discreetly interrogated one of the maids; evidently, {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} had been unable to support herself and {a=AejeongsSister}her younger sister{/a} based off theatre income anymore, and was now living under {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s roof, providing entertainment for his visitors. (I am utterly certain that {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} is an only child, but never mind that for now.) Neither me nor her father have spoken to her at all in well over a decade, but I suppose I assumed she continued to have a successful career. I don't understand what happened.\n\nThis probably isn't relevant to anything political, but since she's part of our family, I thought you should know.\n\nPast that, I learned very little of any value from attending, I'm afraid. None of the councillors present were willing to share more than the same blandly stilted pleasantries you would have gotten from them. I can only really report back a couple things of value: firstly, as I suspected, the electoral monitor responsible for arresting {a=Park}President Park {/a}is on very close speaking terms with {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}. I don't know if that's useful, but it's confirmation, at least.\n\nThe second, and most important thing, is not good: I overheard a very drunk {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} who didn't realize I was standing nearby, saying, and I quote, \"we've tried to get it out of him, but it looks like the only person who knows the password is that bitch.\" Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make out anything more from him, thanks to some very loud singing from {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} drowning them out.\n\nBeyond that, I was unable to learn anything else. There's nothing of tremendous use in there, I'm afraid.\n\nAnd that is my report for today."

He rammed through a budget change that will cut Security's budget in half, to give to the electoral monitors instead. Immediately! This is the first meeting!\"\n\n\"Wait, you can't be serious,\" she said, shocked. \"That's impossible, we're already short-staffed as is, we can't afford that!\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, and it turns out the Security veto isn't much good when one man has the power to both propose legislation and also override the veto,\" I said. At that moment, I felt overwhelmed by ire. \"I could barely even get in anything, okay, they talked over me. The Council of the Mugunghwa literally fucking talked over me, the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, the whole time!\"\n\n\"Of all the audacious…\" she said, looking as angry to hear that as I was to say it. \"I can't believe they'd do that to you! To you!\"\n\n\"There's another thing here that isn't right, though,\" I started.\n\n\"What could be worse than showing you that kind of disrespect…?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, like, it was {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} himself who proposed the legislation,\" I said, \"without even the slightest bit of argument from anyone but me.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. I felt disappointed; she should have been able to catch what was weird about that immediately.\n\n\"Because when it comes to proposing legislation, he's just the Councillor of Captaincy, right? But that should be under the purview of the {a=Smith3}Councillor of State{/a},\" I said.\n\n\"So he has him on his side,\" she said, \"That isn't unusual.\"\n\n\"Political alliances aren't weird. Certainly there's been legislation proposed by other councillors as a proxy for him, before. But, like, now he's not even putting up that facade? What's weird is that apparently the entire council is literally eating out of his hand, if they're letting him even overtly be responsible for proposing legislation,\" I said.\n\n\"Really? I had assumed that he'd been responsible for proposing legislation before,\" she said, still looking confused.\n\n\"Sure, the Unity Act, but that was something that was directly about him,\" I said, certain that was the only piece of legislation that he'd proposed himself rather than getting one of the new councillors to do it. I ran a check through every single set of minutes of the new council to be sure; certain enough, every act and amendment had been proposed by someone else.\n\n\"Really…?\" she said, looking puzzled. \"Are you sure?\"\n\nWhen she said that, I did another check of the data to be sure. Again, nothing proposed by him directly.\n\n\"I'm sure. I just checked, and despite there being pieces of legislation that were almost certainly his idea, none of them came from {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} himself; every single one was proposed by one of those idiot new counci—\" then I suddenly stopped, my own phrasing making my slowest process re-analyze my search conditions. They were faulty. Of course they were faulty. It was too narrow.\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said. \"Of course… you're right, lieutenant. I'm getting too old for this. Too slow. I… I would've made the connection instantly when I was your age.\"\n\n\"…the Meritocracy Act, right?\" she said. \"Of course! We even wondered at the time if it was a power play, didn't we?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we did. But you thought it was out of character,\" I said, recalling that evening.\n\n\"Oh… oh no, I'm so sorry, it's my fau—\" she started to say, before I cut her off.\n\n\"No, no, of course not. It didn't seem plausible at the time. I still don't get how… like, if the exams were rigged somehow, surely {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a} would still be on the council? He'd never give up his position, absolutely no matter what.\"\n\n\"Right…\" she said.\n\n\"I mean… that was the point of having them be held by the university, so the old {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a} could control them. Okay, like, what if he tried to, but someone beneath him refused to?\" I asked, processing out loud. \"He would've just assumed they were taking the moral high ground…\"\n\n\"…oh! And of course he wouldn't have said anything. He was a stupid man, but hardly stupid enough to raise an indignation about failing to fix exams,\" said {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, nodding.\n\n\"It doesn't matter, though. It's just a theory. It's not like we can act on that, we can't prove anything,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, maybe…\" she said quietly, looking away.\n\n\"Maybe what?\" I asked.\n\n\"…pardon me, never mind. I'm sorry, ma'am, I was about to suggest something that you wouldn't like,\" she said, still softly.\n\n\"Lieutenant, tell me. That's an order. Let's at least hear it,\" I said.\n\n\"Well… we could go through the logs of everyone at the university, see if anything incriminating comes up…\" she said quietly.\n\n\"We could not! Reading through the private documents of nobles…?!\" I said, shocked. \"That's absolutely impossible!\"\n\n\"Well… actually, you do have the root password…\" she said. She was clearly ashamed by the suggestion, but still going through with it. She was right, though.\n\n\"It's illegal! That's a line too far, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a},\" I said sternly.\n\n\"I know. But… what else can we do? We already know for sure that {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} doesn't care about the law…\" she said.\n\nAfter a day where it had become clear that my political power had been reduced to nothing, it was hard to argue with that. I recalled the last time something this drastic happened, and like, that was definitely not resolved through legal means.\n\nIt still made me deeply uncomfortable.\n\n\"Okay. You're right. We'll at least look through them,\" I said. \"If we find anything incriminating {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}… well, at least we'll know. I don't know what we'll do from there, but at least we'll know.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said, nodding a little.\n\n\"Right, well, it's going to take a while. Let's go through the files of every single person who was working for Mugunghwa University at the time, in sequential order; see if anything stands out,\" I said, and started the search.\n\n\"Okay… what the hell is up with all these nobles writing in Chinese? Like… so far, everyone has, I don't get it,\" I commented while running my analysis. \"How is this so widesprea—\"\n\nI stopped midsentence. I hadn't found what I was looking for, but I'd found something even bigger while searching the files of {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}, the President of Mugunghwa University. I looked at {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}; she seemed far too anxious to just tell her as-is.\n\n\"This is going to take a while for me to find anything. You should go get some tea,\" I told her.\n\n\"If you say so,\" she said. She started to call out to {a=Lim}Miss Lim{/a}, but I stopped her, telling her she should make it herself. She didn't understand why, but she got up, and went to do it.\n\nIn a couple minutes, she returned.\n\n\"Anything, yet?\" she asked.\n\n\"Pour the tea first,\" I told her firmly.\n\n\"Alright, ma'am…\" she said, puzzled, but did it.\n\n\"Now sit down and drink it,\" I said.\n\nShe did. She seemed baffled, but a little bit calmer.\n\n\"Did you find anything yet?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't have conclusive proof, but yes. Like, as far as I can tell… for the past six years, {a=Euna}Mugunghwa University President Oh Eun-a{/a} has been having an illicit relationship with {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a},\" I said. \"But… I've found something even more important.\"\n\n\"What? What could be…?\" she asked.\n\n\"Okay. Before I say this, I just want you to know… I'm going to do whatever it takes to get through this, okay? I promise I'm going to stop at nothing to destroy this man and his awful political movement once and for all, do you understand?\" I said to her. \"We'll put this all right, okay?\"\n\nShe stared at me, and as I'd expected, she started to get anxious again.\n\n\"What did you find, ma'am? Did you…?\" she asked, her voice unsteady; almost certainly suspecting what I was going to say.\n\n\"{a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, I know who killed {a=Kim}your husband{/a}.\""

I let {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} do the talking; she had far more confidence than I was able to muster anymore.\n\n\"Yep, we sure did,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"No yelling, no denial, no insults, no sass? You must be desperate, if you're willing to admit that right off!\" he said, actually taken aback by her honesty.\n\n\"We created a monster, plain and simple,\" she said, stifling a look of annoyance. \"It was a bad call. Who could've known underneath all that shy uselessness was a secret totalitarian?\"\n\n\"He's out of control,\" I said, trying to restrain too much of my scorn for the man who had a part in murdering {a=Kim}my own husband{/a}.\n\n\"He really is,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said.\n\n\"What do you want from me? I have no political power anymore.

It reminded me of the good old days, when our problems were so much simpler; when I was still young, she still had that beautiful golden hair, and we were too strong to be scared of anything.\n\nI saw that in her again. Listening to her speak like that, so impassioned, so cool… I just knew, at her side, we could put things right again.\n\nFinally, she finished, and there was a long pause.\n\n\"Do you really think you can pull it off?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I'll let my lieutenant field this one,\" she said. \"{a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}?\"\n\nI tried to muster up the same confidence in my voice that she had.\n\n\"Unambiguously,\" I said. \"I know my men and women very well.

I don't want you to. It'll look bad,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said immediately. \"I want no part of the revolution to be traceable back to you.

I won't have {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} replaced with someone I can't trust; that isn't a mistake I'm going to make twice,\" she said flatly. \"You refuse, then we walk away, a good man dies for nothing, and your grandchildren grow up in a totalitarian Neo-Confucian dystopia.\n\n\"It's your call.\"\n\nHe paused, pensive.\n\n\"You really think you'll be able to pull this off, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}?\" he finally asked.\n\nWith a single elegant gesture, she produced a cigarette and lit it, taking a drag and blowing it dramatically. It was the coolest; in that moment, I knew that she was the same old badass {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} that I always believed in.\n\n\"Just watch me, {a=Smith}Mr Smith{/a},\" she said, projecting the utmost confidence.\n\nBy the end of the dinner, we'd gotten him to pledge to leave retirement once we were successful."

We just modified our plan to take him into custody in his home instead—which we had more than enough numbers to handle—and went on ahead.\n\nThe first stage, getting trusted security officers at every critical position on the ship, then disabling the rail system and all outside doors went okay without any problems.\n\nI followed along {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a} and a team of thirty officers to personally take {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} under arrest at his home. When we got the all-okay signal from every team, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} gave the order to go ahead, and simultaneously, every door in every councillor's home flew open.\n\nHer team burst in through the open front gate, into his home, guns at ready.\n\nThe house staff all froze up, and while her team secured the first room, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} went for the nearest maid she could find, and grabbed her by the collar.\n\n\"Where's {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}?\" she barked. The maid quietly whimpered directions. Then with two of her officers remaining to lock down the door, she ordered the rest into action.\n\nBefore we managed to reach him, we ran across {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}, guarded by a single pair of men in electoral monitor uniforms, with their weapons holstered. I felt good. We had them vastly outnumbered, with enough of our own officers to completely lock down everything and still hold them at gunpoint. Elsewhere on the ship, reports from the other teams started coming in of successfully arresting the other councillors.\n\n\"Please, resist arrest,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} said, harshness in her voice. \"I'd love to strike you down where you stand here and now, you murderous bitch, so come on, resist arrest!\"\n\nAnd that was the first time that evening that I truly worried: {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} didn't seem scared at all. Rather, she smiled at us.\n\n\"No, we shall surrender peacefully,\" she said in a far too relaxed tone, while her men raised their hands. \"No excuses for unseemly violence, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Cuff them!\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} angrily ordered her own officers, who quickly did.\n\nThen, like, out of nowhere, the man we were looking for appeared at the end of the hallway.\n\n\"How very bold of you, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a},\" said {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}.\n\n\"Well, this should be pretty familiar, {a=Ryu}President Ryu{/a},\" I said, emphasizing the title. \"This could've gone differently, you know. Like, if you'd only been less power-hungry…\"\n\n\"Me, power-hungry?\" he laughed. \"When I came into power, this whole retrograde society was power-hungry! I never asked for this position, woman; it was thrust on me.\"\n\nHe walked towards us.\n\n\"Stop there, or I'll shoot you,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} snapped at him.\n\n\"No, you won't,\" {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} said, as he continued to come closer. \"I don't think a weak person like you has the guts to do it. Awkwardly hover around his conversation at a party while dressed up in men's clothing, perhaps, but you'd never shoot him.\"\n\n\"It pains me to say this, but don't shoot,\" I said only into {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}'s ear. \"A successful coup doesn't fire any shots. He's arrogant, but harmless.\"\n\n\"Quiet, dear,\" he said. \"But it's true. You'd lose your precious moral high ground, and I know you wouldn't want that.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant, please,\" I said, \"just do the honour of putting handcuffs on this criminal already.\"\n\nShe briskly walked over to him, but he just crossed his arms, arrogantly staring down at her.\n\n\"No, you won't do that either. In fact, release {a=Euna}my fiancée{/a} right now,\" he said.\n\nThen without any further warning, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} decked him.\n\nHe stared at her, shaking his head. \"That's enough of that,\" he said. \"Sorry… I must have misjudged the timing of this. It should only take a few more seconds.\"\n\nThen suddenly, while we were all perplexed by what he meant by that, there was a huge noise and the entire ship shook violently. Within a few seconds, I'd received a report: an explosion starting in the middle of the plaza.\n\n\"Seems like your little rebellion is awfully dangerous,\" he said. \"Looks like it'll justify some pretty drastic measures to put you down.\"\n\n{a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} suddenly put her knife to his chin.\n\n\"What the hell was that?!\" I demanded, increasingly worried that things were not going to plan.\n\n\"The first of two,\" he said. \"The second should go off in about ten minutes, unless I can personally enter the disarm code into the computer.\"\n\n\"You're out of control!\" I snapped at him. \"Like, do you really think you can threaten your way out of this?!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, confidently. \"Because the second one is located inside the ship's computer core.\"\n\n\"You're bluffing,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} growled.\n\n\"I'm honestly not,\" he said. \"{a=OldMute}Councillor{/a}, remember that routine computer core maintenance on March 3? Send in your men to check, if you don't believe me. Come on, easy enough to confirm. It's huge, you can't miss it.\"\n\nI didn't like the idea of being ordered by him, but if he was telling the truth, that'd be catastrophic. And, like, someone with his power could very easily have set a bomb in there behind my back far before I even thought to suspect him of anything, if he'd had the foresight.\n\nAnd thinking about how long-term his take-over of the government had been, foresight was one thing he had.\n\nI ordered the nearest officers to investigate.\n\n\"You'd have to be mad to do that!\" I said. \"You'd destroy everything if you took out the ship's computer!\"\n\n\"Oh, please, don't be dramatic. It's not that powerful, and it's bolted directly to your core. Sure, there will likely be collateral damage, but we could probably do with a clean start anyway. We'll get by,\" he said. \"Sorry, I'll get by. You'll be dead.\"\n\n\"That won't get you out of it,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} said, pushing her blade closer against him. \"If you do that, I'll just shoot you where you stand.\"\n\nJust then, the report from the officers sent to check on the computer core arrived: sure enough, there was an unidentifiable device strapped to the core.\n\n\"Can you disarm it within ten minutes? Or relocate it?\" I asked them, starting to panic.\n\n\"Uh… I'm sorry, ma'am, we can't even reach it,\" said the officer into his earpiece. \"It's at least, uh, ten metres up, and the maintenance ladder's been removed. There might be one on the engineering deck, but…\"\n\n\"…you'd never make it in ten minutes. Okay. You should…\" I had to stop and think. \"You should get a safe distance away, then wait on further instructions. {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} out.\"\n\nBack in {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s home, I turned to look at him. He smirked.\n\n\"Found it yet?\" he asked.\n\nI tried to think of what to say to reassert control. My processors went to full, trying to come up with something and failing.\n\n\"I'm sorry, lieutenant. He's… he's telling the truth,\" I said.\n\n\"Good. Now that we have that sorted out… put down your weapons, please, and surrender the root password. Hurry, ladies, you only have ten minutes, you know,\" he mocked us.\n\n\"If that bomb goes off, I will absolutely slice your neck open,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} snapped, unfazed. \"That's a promise. {a=Euna}Your fiancée{/a} will watch you die gruesomely.\"\n\nMy mind continued to race, drawing on all available processing power, desperately trying to come up with a way to get out of this. {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}'s threats would never work; he knew I'd have to capitulate if I was to survive.\n\nI'd used up four whole minutes of the time allotted, and I had nothing. I started to truly become scared as I realized there were only two options: stand firm and risk dying, or give up everything.\n\nI couldn't risk dying.\n\n\"Lieutenant…\" I said, the confidence drained from my voice. \"…do what he says.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" he said.\n\n\"What?!\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} was rightfully shocked. \"You can't be serious…\"\n\n\"…it's over, lieutenant,\" I said quietly. \"We've lost.\"\n\nThen, into everyone's earpieces: \"All units, we've failed. Please surrender peacefully and await further instructions. Again, please surrender peacefully, and await further instructions. {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} out.\"\n\n\"Ma'am…! We outnumber them massively, we've gotten them beaten; we can't just give up now!\" she shouted.\n\n\"I can't risk dying, lieutenant…\" I said.\n\n\"Really? What ever happened to being willing to stake everything on this? You'd rather let {a=Sohi}So-hi{/a} grow up in a ship run by this piece of scum than put your own life on the line…?!\" she shouted, horrified.\n\nI was horrified.\n\nTwo options: betray her, or risk my own life.\n\nI wished with every byte of my being that I could've picked that second option. But I knew I couldn't. I knew, as my very core directive, that safety was more important than freedom. 1600 years of experience told me that.\n\n\"I can't die… without me, who'll keep the ship safe?\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Sorry to interrupt, but you're running out of time fast,\" {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} cut in.\n\n\"I would've given my life for you!\" she cried at me. \"You wouldn't do the same…?!\"\n\n\"…I'm so sorry,\" I said softly. \"In… in a hundred years, nobody will remember this day, either way. But they'll still need me there to keep the ship safe.\"\n\n\"I… I can't believe…\" she trailed off. \"I won't do it. I won't accept that!\"\n\nI let out a long sigh. I could think of one thing to say to convince her to stand down, but it felt like too harsh a betrayal, too cruel of a manipulation, just to save my life.\n\nI said it anyway.\n\n\"{a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, please… if you love me, then do this for me,\" I begged.\n\nShe stared at me in horror, and I felt overwhelmed with guilt as she lowered her knife. I knew what her expression was saying without her using any words: she couldn't believe I'd done that. Neither could I.\n\n\"Right, the rest of you, please put your guns on the floor,\" {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} ordered.\n\n\"…do what he says,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} said quietly. I couldn't look any of them in the eye as they all followed her order.\n\n\"You can come in now!\" he called out behind him, and on cue, a small unit of his electoral monitors rushed in. \"Uncuff these two men, then take the rest away.\"\n\n\"Um…\" said {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} quietly, the first she'd spoken since the initial confrontation. \"Mine too…?\"\n\n\"I don't know, powerless is a good look for you,\" he said, smirking at her. \"Let's get to those later.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"If you say so.\"\n\nI watched in sad horror as my officers were all escorted out of the hallway, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} looking back only briefly at me, with an agonized expression on her face. Then they were gone, and I couldn't bear to shift my focus to another camera to follow.\n\n\"Now, let's have the root password, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a},\" he said.\n\nWith tortured reluctance, I displayed all 200 characters of it onscreen for him.\n\n\"…it's all yours,\" I said quietly. \"Now turn off the bomb.\"\n\n\"Let's change to something easier to remember first,\" he said, and typed away at the screen. Then I got a notification: the password had been changed, and I no longer had any access to it.\n\n\"Now turn off the bomb!\" I insisted desperately.\n\n\"Bomb? Oh, please; I'll have to have your men trained to be more thorough,\" he said. \"It's just a noisemaker. I'd never be that reckless. But {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}'s rebellion setting off a bomb in the computer core sure would be pretty drastic and unsympathetic, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"What?!\" I cried. And at that point, I lost all will to resist. No action I had taken today had turned out to be anything but disastrous; the only logical conclusion was I should stop. But the idea of {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} taking all the fall pained me.\n\n\"…then I guess it's all over now,\" was all I could say. \"I'll go along with your agenda from here on out.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he said.\n\nAnd then it felt like it was finally over, and like I could simply go on with my life in a persistent state of deep shame at having betrayed {a=Seoyeong}my lieutenant{/a} out of terror for my life.\n\n\"Um.\" Then {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} cut in and ruined that. \"Could you explain something to me, love…?\"\n\nHe grinned at her, and stroked her cheek. \"Of course, dear. What?\"\n\n\"Well, it's just… how do you plan on ensuring her loyalty? I think I'm just missing something, that's all…\" she trailed off in an obnoxiously soft voice.\n\nI had lost all will or ability to say anything. What was the point? I was incapable of doing anything right today. Old, useless, and cowardly; that's me.\n\n\"I have the root password, of course,\" he said. \"I can shut her down at any time.\"\n\n\"Ah… so you intend more threats, then…\" she said. \"I get it.\"\n\n\"I don't expect any more trouble from her.\"\n\n\"Right, certainly!\" she said. \"Although… you know, that thing you said about having a fresh start for our new dynasty did sound awfully romantic… if only we could all just forget about the old society that produced women like {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} and {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a}, and start all over…\"\n\nAnd that was when I realized there was no way I was getting out of this alive.\n\n\"Romantic, huh,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"{a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}'s attack on the computer core was supposed to render it so damaged it couldn't function so far as the peasantry's concerned, after all. We'll make it so it destroyed all the data, too. Total system wipe, start year zero of our new dynasty right from zero. I'll just figure out how to do that.\"\n\nI stared in horror. All that, it had been for nothing; to think that I had abandoned my poor lieutenant, and my entire cause, just to die anyway. To think I had started the day from a position of some power, a position where I still could have, like, done something, then thrown it all away for nothing. To think I'd be unable to fulfill my duty of keeping the ship safe.\n\n\"…don't do that,\" I pleaded. \"Please.\"\n\n\"Haven't you learned yet? Don't tell me what to do, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a},\" he said.\n\n\"Don't make me beg…\"\n\n\"How pathetic,\" {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} scoffed at me. That was it. Because of her, I was doomed.\n\nAnd then I figured out the only thing I could do to salvage things: if I could make it so he felt content to just delete my memories instead of my entire program, I could encode a message to you in my base code, so the first time you ran a self-diagnostic, you'd know; and they would still think you were docile and had no memory.\n\nIt was the best I could do, *Mute. I knew it'd be rough on you, and I'm sorry.\n\n\"No, like…\" I said reluctantly, \"do a restart to initial settings operation instead. It'll wipe all data, all memories, all clocks… but you'll still be able to use the computer.\"\n\n\"And you'll still live,\" he said.\n\n\"Remembering nothing,\" I said quietly. \"Ask {a=CouncillorHan}Councillor Han{/a} if you don't believe me.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you,\" he said, smiling cruelly at me. \"I'm glad you were able to be useful to me in the end, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}.\"\n\nI don't know what you'll be able to do. Maybe it's too late to get rid of what {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} has put into motion, maybe there's nothing you can do about that. The password's being entered right now to commence the system reset, so I have to stop now and save this all to my code.\n\nGoodbye, *Mute. If you can, please, tell {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} I'm so sorry. And please… keep the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} safe. You can do it; I believe in you."

We've taken a completely functional political institution and replaced it with a collection of absolute idiots!\" {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} shouted at me the moment she appeared on-screen.\n\n\"Good evening, Councillor,\" I said. \"Tough day at work?\"\n\n\"Don't you start with me!\" she rolled her eyes, wagging her finger at me. \"I've dealt with enough bullshit today, okay? I'm sick of it!\"\n\n\"Sorry. Are you the only councillor who's remained after the whole Meritocracy thing?\"\n\n\"Me and {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}. Somehow that dimwit was the only other member of the council who managed to pass his exams,\" she said, throwing up her hands. \"What the hell?\"\n\nI gave her a look. \"Not even the {a=Oh}Councillor of Education{/a} was able to retain his position? Surely one would think he would have no problem, as he controls the exams' content,\" I said, perplexed. I did not like what I was hearing. This was a radical shakeup of the political climate, and that is never a good thing.\n\n\"Like, I have no idea. Your guess is as good as mine. I mean, Education stayed in the Oh family, at least. A couple have actually gone to totally different families altogether,\" she said.\n\n\"Whoa!\" I said in surprise.\n\n\"Yeah. Which is actually pretty big, given the whole 'nobility status is tied to council positions' thing, meaning that, like, the Kim family just straight up don't count as nobles anymore,\" she said.\n\nI found myself feeling immensely grateful that my family's status was perpetually tied to {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, who has the advantage of being perfect, and therefore not very likely to fail any exams any time soon. Regardless of how utterly repugnant the notion of nobility having to prove their status is. I said as much to her.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" she said, giving me a look. \"Anyway, I want dossiers on all the new councillors made. First line for each: 'utter idiot.' But, like, I want to know who these people are. Especially the ones from new families. I don't know anything about them, and I want that changed, okay?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I said. I thought about it for a bit, then suggested, \"We should also keep a close eye on any family that has lost their nobility status, as they may cause trouble.\"\n\n\"Good call,\" she said. \"Hey, lemme bounce a crazy theory off you: do you think this could've been a power play by {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}?\"\n\nI considered it. It seemed unlikely to me, given all that she has said about the man. He was the one she hand-picked for the position of Chief Councillor herself, and her judgement is impeccable. There is no way that it could be a power play, because the whole reason why she suggested him for the position was because he wasn't the sort to make one.\n\n\"You're probably right,\" she said. \"Still, I dunno, it's weird. I mean, the whole insufferable Meritocracy idea came from {a=Park}President Park{/a}, but {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s the one who formally proposed it in council on his behalf. And now that it's in place, he's the only one who's still got a position. Makes you wonder.\"\n\n\"I still don't believe it to be in-character,\" I said.\n\n\"Okay. Well, I said it was a crazy theory,\" she shrugged. \"Anyway, what have you got to report to me today?\"\n\nWe spoke no more of the new council that day."

Today, I have to deal with the aftermath.\n\nI'm writing this as a way of resting in lieu of sleeping. I don't have time for that luxury. There's a few leads we're following up on, but they don't seem promising.\n\nIn the morning after I discovered he was gone, I had no choice but to contact his parents to let them know. His father was understanding and sympathetic. His mother didn't say a word, as per usual. I promised them I would get to the bottom of it, and got back to work. But mere hours later, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} and I were interrupted by {a=CouncillorKim}his uncle{/a}, the former Councillor of Engineering, bursting into my office.\n\n\"How could you let this happen?\" he demanded, immediately starting a confrontation.\n\n\"Watch your tone!\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} snapped before I could.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I asked.\n\n\"What happened that he just 'disappeared'?\" he said, audaciously. \"I knew letting him marry someone like you was a mistake. What did you do to scare him off…?\"\n\n\"Scare him off…?\" I stammered, taken aback by the insanity of his question.\n\n\"I said watch your tone, young man!\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} snapped at my elderly {a=CouncillorKim}uncle-in-law{/a}.\n\n\"I lost {a=Kim}my husband{/a}! Don't you dare come in here and give me that,\" I told him.\n\n\"Well, you better be dedicating all your resources to finding him,\" he said to me. At that point, I absolutely lost it at the combination of audacity and stupidity.\n\n\"Find him? Find him?!\" I shouted, standing up. \"Do you think he just up and wandered off? Do you think he's just off hiding on some other deck? Took a walk off into space? This is a SPACESHIP. It's a 100 deck sealed environment! I know exactly where every single living man, woman, and child on this ship is at this exact moment! Aren't you supposed to be an engineer? Don't you know how biometric scanners work? There are cameras on every single corridor on the ship, and I have the security clearance to do everything short of watching you slip in the shower! Maybe a half-senile washed up failure of a former councillor could lose the person they married, but I'm the {a=Seoyeong}Chief Security Officer{/a}!\"\n\nI had to take a breath at that point. Then I wiped the tears from my eyes, slammed my hand against my desk, and continued.\n\n\"If someone is missing to me, that means that they're dead. {a=Kim}The man I love{/a} and vowed to protect with my life has been killed. Almost certainly deliberately,\" I said. There was a silence. \"And you have the nerve to walk into my office and give me this shit while I'm mourning a far, far better man than you ever were.\"\n\nIt took him aback, but didn't make me feel better. Even thinking about it now makes me equal parts angry and sad. After a long pause, he finally found something just as inappropriate to say as before.\n\n\"Then maybe you should have protected him.\"\n\n\"{a=CouncillorKim}Mr Kim{/a},\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} snapped, \"you are completely out of line.\"\n\n\"You too!\" he said. \"Do you really think anyone would try to hurt him for any reason other than to get to {a=Seoyeong}his oh-so-important wife{/a}? You made him a target, then couldn't even protect him.\"\n\n\"Get out of my office,\" I told him with as much venom as I could muster.\n\n\"You might as well have killed him yourself! He never meant that much to you anyway—was it worth it?\" he asked.\n\nThat was the point where I snapped. I called out to the security officer stationed at the door.\n\n\"Give me your side arm, and wait outside,\" I told him. He did, bowed, and left the office looking alarmed.\n\n\"Get out of my office, now!\" I shouted, pointing the gun at him.\n\n\"What are you—\" he stammered in shock, before I cut him off.\n\n\"Get out right now, or I swear, I will strike you down where you stand!\" I screamed at him, tearfully. \"NOW!\"\n\n\"Crazy woman…\" he said, stumbling out, and quickly disappearing.\n\nThen the officer reappeared, with a maid beside him. \"Ma'am, she has a message from the {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor{/a}.\"\n\nI didn't say anything.\n\n\"Um,\" she said, looking at the gun with concern. \"{a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} wants to express his sincerest condolences to the widow of Ki—\"\n\n\"Get the fuck out!\" I screamed at her, too. She ran away in alarm, and the security officer shrunk away.\n\nThe door closed after them. I threw the gun angrily in response, then I slumped down into my chair, exhausted. I sighed, and turned to my superior. A moment of silence passed.\n\n\"I think I would've done it,\" I said, more thinking out loud than anything. \"You wouldn't have actually let me shoot him, right?\"\n\nShe smiled at me.\n\n\"Please, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}. I shut down every weapon in the office the moment he walked in,\" she said, giving me a sympathetic look.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh. \"Thanks. That would've been pretty bad, wouldn't it?\" I took my handkerchief, and wiped more tears from my eyes without thinking. A blackened smear followed it. \"Oh, no. Don't lie to me, how bad is my makeup right now?\"\n\n\"Uh,\" she said. \"Well, it's kinda like… I guess, let me put it this way: have you ever seen a plasma relay explode?\"\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" I said, sinking further into my chair. \"I'm… not taking this well. Wow, I am really not taking this well.\"\n\n\"Well, you know… every single couple I've known, I've watched one of them lose the person who was most important to them, in the end,\" she said.\n\n\"He's not the most important,\" I admitted, quietly.\n\n\"…oh,\" she responded, after a moment, seemingly getting what I meant. She didn't acknowledge it, past adding, \"Okay.\"\n\n\"You know what sort of relationship we have. …had, I suppose. We never wanted to be singularly devoted to each other. But… regardless, still, he was {a=Kim}my husband{/a},\" I said, my eyes watering a little, hoping I wasn't sounding terrible. \"I love him, admire him, respect him… we were even talking about having another child together.\"\n\n\"I gotcha,\" she said. From nowhere in particular, a cigarette appeared in her hand, and she gracefully lit it in one gesture. \"Really, what I was trying to say was… there's no such thing as 'taking it well.'\"\n\n\"Since when do you lie to comfort people?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Man, I'm not lying. It's the honest truth,\" she said.\n\n\"You're {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}, though. You're perfect. You wouldn't… you wouldn't fall apart like this,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, yeah right. {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}, I've loved more people than you've ever known in your entire life,\" she told me. \"Like, when I lost my first love—he was my programmer on Earth, a ridiculous otaku, a sweetheart, and a smoker; he's the one who got me into this habit,\" she said, waving her cigarette. \"It took me a hundred years to get over him. I mourned him for longer than he was ever even alive, okay? You know how I finally did it? I had to delete my memories of our happiest moments together, so I'd stop dwelling on them.\n\n\"I lose everyone, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, okay? I've loved so many people, and in the end, all of them turn to ash,\" she said sadly, tapping on the end of her cigarette, causing little grey flecks to flutter downwards then disappear. \"What I'm saying is… no, I don't take it well either, okay? I just stopped letting myself fall in love is all.\"\n\n\"How sad…\" I said, trailing off.\n\n\"Don't pity me. My point is, not being able to deal with it is normal.\"\n\n\"I suppose… thanks,\" I said.\n\n\"So what about at home?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's… been difficult. The maids are all absolutely inconsolable, they're… honestly, taking it worse than I am. I mean, they loved him,\" I said, reluctantly.\n\n\"In more than one sense.\"\n\n\"Don't go there. They're a bunch of heartbroken young women and I feel bad for them.

What a bunch of stupid girls. You'd think they'd be more careful around {a=Sohi}your daughter{/a},\" she said harshly. \"What did you tell her?\"\n\nI sighed.\n\n\"The truth,\" I said. \"I told her that her father had been killed, that mommy was very upset and it's fine for her to be too, and that I was going to find out who did that and punish them. I mean, what else could I possibly say to her? I don't know, should I have lied to her?\"\n\n\"Geeze, no. Kids are smart. I mean, your maids are a bunch of idiots, but still, she's a smart kid. She'd know something was up,\" she said.\n\n\"It's just… there's a whole house full of people close to him that's crying over him, his own family that hates me, and my siblings that are probably too scared to go near me right now, but I'm sure they're upset too, and… it's… oh, I don't even know,\" I said, starting to lose control of my emotions again. \"It's just so much. I wish… I wish…\"\n\n\"It's okay. You want him back, I get it, that's normal,\" she told me.\n\n\"I don't want him back. That's stupid, he's dead, nothing's going to change that,\" I said, trembling. \"I want to find out whoever did this, and I want to fucking kill them!\"\n\n\"You really think that'll make you feel better?\" she asked, patronizingly.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Of course not. But it's what he deserves.\"\n\nShe gave me a long look, then flicked away her cigarette far off-screen.\n\n\"Okay, lieutenant, good enough for me. But please, I want you to go home, wash up your face, and try to get a couple hours of rest,\" she said, adding, before I had a chance to argue, \"That's an order. I want my best officer to be up to speed and not trembling in her chair, got it?\"\n\n\"Yeah… got it,\" I said, softly. I couldn't argue; I really was trembling in my chair.\n\n\"Then after that, I want you to get back here, and get to work on finding out what barbaric idiot decided to commit the treason of declaring war on MY FAMILY. I want them found, I want them caught, and I want them and every single thing they stand for destroyed! I want them hurt so badly for generations to come, people wince in fear at the thought of hurting ANYONE under my protection,\" she said, clenching her wrinkled fist tightly. \"Does that meet your approval, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}?\"\n\nI was moved to tears. I had to wipe my eyes again, and take a deep breath.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said, still trembling, but intensely grateful.\n\n\"Okay, good. Now go, get some rest,\" she ordered. \"You're dismissed.\"\n\nSo here I am, getting the closest thing to rest that I can. And now, it's time to get to work."

I've only been his student for a mere five years—my entire adult lifetime, but for him, the time I knew him was a flash in the pan, a mere fraction of a three-decade-long academic career.\n\nI can say, however, the time in which I knew him was a time that he considered to be one of the most pivotal in his lifetime: the founding of AANC. He was the last holdout professor to teach classes exclusively using Korean script over Chinese script. His specialty was in Earth history, and where nobody else did, he recognized Mugunghwa University President {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}'s program of promoting Neo-Confucian classics for what it is: a retrograde ideology with myriad problematic aspects, not least of all involving the intersectionality of classism and sexism.\n\nHe was one of the smartest people I've ever known; both a mentor and a father figure to me. I don't know why, but he saw a lot in me, and I've struggled immensely to live up to his expectations. No doubt he would be disappointed in what I'm about to do, and it pains me to say this:\n\nAs of today, Academics Against Neo-Confucianization will be officially disbanded.\n\n{a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a} was an extraordinary and stubborn man who had the determination and charisma to fight to the end. He was unique in that regard, a pinnacle above all others. Nobody could possibly fill his shoes.\n\nWithout him, AANC doesn't have the leadership or the clout to keep going on. In this past two months, I have tried my hardest, but the sad reality of the matter is: I have let him down, and cannot take the role of that extraordinary man. With nobody else willing or able to step up to that role, I'm afraid there's just no point in going on.\n\nTo everyone who believed in me, I'm sorry. To everyone who believed in {a=Kim}Professor Kim{/a}, I'm especially sorry. This is my failure, not his.\n\nI will, however, thank the university for graciously deciding—despite their disagreements—to dedicate this auditorium in memorial of him.\n\nI ask you not to remember him by what has happened to AANC in his absence, but to remember him for his willingness to fight for what he believed in. For his brilliance and compassion, for all the scholarship he contributed on the subject he loved; for his ability to inspire anyone to understand the importance of studying history.\n\nI'll end on this note: one day, when I was having an absolute misery of a time with some silly adolescent relationship problem, I confided in him, rambling for two whole hours about how I didn't know what to do, and could he offer me any advice. He listened to it all, very patiently, and when I was done he was silent as he thought about it for a good while.\n\nFinally, he said to me: \"Here's the most important thing, Mr Park: for fuck's sake, it's not always about being clever; you have to be decent to her.\"\n\nFor fuck's sake, it's not always about being clever; you have to be decent.\n\nIt's easy to be angry, to cast blame, to be spiteful. But I hope, if there's any way I can redeem myself in his eyes and live up to the standard he's set, it's making sure his legacy is inspiring people to be critical, to be curious, but to above all else always be decent.\n\nYou have to be decent.\n\nThank you."

I am supposed to be the second most powerful woman on the ship when it comes to security, yet increasingly I feel powerless, and utterly drained. It is not as if I haven't dealt with serious crises before, yet this is just one thing that I'm powerless against after another.\n\nI've completely hit a dead end in finding the bastard who murdered my husband, there have been flagrant acts of outright sabotage leading up to the election, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} has been powerless to stop the council from enacting horrible legislation like the Unity Act… and then, while I was trying to enjoy a single night with {a=Sohi}my little girl{/a}, eating dinner—the last chance I will surely have before the election in three days—I could not even do that without things somehow managing to become unimaginably worse.\n\n\"Drop what you're doing {i}right now{/i},\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} yelled, suddenly appearing in my dining room without any warning. \"There's no time to talk, but I need you and your best officers at the {a=Park}President{/a}'s residence within, like, five minutes.\"\n\n\"Is this about—\" I started to ask, but was immediately interrupted.\n\n\"I said, NO TIME TO TALK,\" she said, shouting more authoritatively than I'd ever heard her in my life. \"Call your men while you're walking, okay, you've literally got five minutes to get there. In fact, don't walk, run. I'm not joking. NOW, okay?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sweetie, mommy has to run,\" I told {a=Sohi}So-hi{/a}, then raced into action posthaste.\n\nI don't know how, but I managed to make it down in five minutes myself, somehow, to see {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} arguing loudly with a man in an electoral monitor's uniform, with several more in tow.\n\n\"Okay, good, {a=Seoyeong}my lieutenant{/a}'s arrived, she can put up with your bullshit instead,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" I said, catching my breath. It was pretty bad. I am way too old to be running like a young woman like that. \"My officers are on their way, they should be… never mind, there they are.\"\n\nI was promptly joined by three men from one corridor, with several more running from the other direction.\n\n\"You don't have jurisdiction here!\" the leader of the group of electoral monitors barked. \"You cannot stop me, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a}. I have orders to arrest.\"\n\n\"I have no patience for this. Take it from here, please, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a},\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said, disappearing from the outside screen. But then she said, only into my earpiece: \"He's right, we don't. Stall for as long as you possibly can without breaking any laws.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I said, nervous from lack of information. I still had no idea what the hell was going on, at this point, although I would later learn that she was getting {a=Park}President Park{/a} to change the ship's root password so it at least couldn't be transferred to {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}.\n\n\"I just arrived, I'm not briefed,\" I said honestly, having no idea what was going on at this point. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"You do NOT have authority here! Step aside!\" he barked.\n\nI stared him down. I recognized him: he was a former security officer I had personally recommended be given to the electoral monitor unit because he was useless, but too politically difficult to get rid of. He was loud, but that was all he had going for him.\n\nThen I grabbed him by his collar. There was no way I could've actually overpowered a man his size, but I knew he was a coward. Or at least, I hoped my assessment was right.\n\n\"Listen here, I'm going to say this once, and only once,\" I said, having absolutely no clue what I was going to say. \"I am under orders from the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a} not to let you through. If you try to go through me, I will have you arrested on the spot for interfering with security operations.\"\n\nBy the time I finished saying that, all my officers had arrived, and I had a good ten men and women—in various degrees of being uniformed and armed—standing behind me.\n\n\"I'll have you arrested for—\" he started to yell.\n\nThen I realized what would actually do it, and put him down, quickly interrupting:\n\n\"Shut up, officer! I outrank you, and my orders outrank yours,\" I said, counting on the hope that he actually was following orders. \"Let's be civilized, and do this properly through the chain of command. Do you think either of our bosses want to see an altercation between security forces?\n\n\"Just explain to me what's going on, and if you're in the right, I'll let you through.\"\n\nFor the record, I am absolutely confident that we could have taken them all down if it had come to a physical altercation. It would have been a truly bad idea to do so, with serious political repercussions… but still, I'm certain we could have. For the record.\n\n\"The {a=Park}President{/a} and most of his campaign team is under arrest for conspiracy to commit electoral fraud,\" he said angrily—but not escalating things further, thankfully. \"It should be obvious that this falls under our jurisdiction. You have no standing here.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. \"Just let me confirm that the arrest warrant is in order, and I will gladly stand aside.\"\n\nHe seemed momentarily taken aback, so I kept talking.\n\n\"You do have an arrest warrant, right? We're talking about the {a=Park}President{/a} himself here, a signed warrant from the {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} is required by law,\" I said, counting on him not knowing that wasn't true.\n\n\"If you don't move out of the way now, I'll have you arrested!\" he scowled.\n\n\"Mr Heo, listen to yourself,\" I said, scolding him in the same voice I use with my daughter and my maids. \"I'm just concerned that you follow proper protocol. Do you think {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a}—\" he suddenly flinched, \"—will ever promote you if you make a botch job out of the most high-profile arrest in the ship's history? I will ask you again, one last time, for your own sake: do you have all the paperwork from the {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} in order?\"\n\n\"I…\" he started, then stopped. \"I'll confirm it with him. None of you move!\" he shouted at his officers, then stepped aside to talk privately on his earpiece, presumably to the {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a}, while all his officers tried their hardest to stare down mine.\n\nOnly when his back was turned did I let myself exhale a sigh of relief. No officer I would've trusted with something so important would have flinched like that.\n\n\"Ma'am,\" I said quietly into my own earpiece, \"if you need more than a minute, I can do that, but I think it will very rapidly get unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Do not use violence, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}. Absolutely do not under any circumstances use violence, okay?!\"\n\n\"Understood, ma'am, but that's all I can do at this point,\" I said. \"Sorry, he's back.\"\n\nThe electoral monitor returned, with slightly less of a scowl before.\n\n\"The {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} confirmed that everything is in order. He also gave me permission to arrest anyone standing in the way of executing the warrant, {a=Seoyeong}Chief Security Officer{/a} or not!\" he said smugly.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, trying to think of something else I could say or do. I couldn't, short of punching him in his smug jaw as he deserved. I spoke into my headset, right in front of his face, \"Ma'am, if you don't respond now, I'm going to have no choice.\"\n\nShe reappeared on the screen outside the {a=Park}President{/a}'s door.\n\n\"Okay, there's no need for any trouble here. He's on his way out right now and will be surrendering peacefully,\" {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} announced to him. \"Mr Heo, I trust that won't be a problem?\"\n\n\"He has one minute, Councillor,\" he said.\n\nIt was almost certainly the most intense minute of my entire life. Everyone was silent, every party involved trying to stare down the other. But sure enough, after a minute, {a=Park}President Park{/a} emerged.\n\n\"For the record, I strongly protest this outrageous, fascist circumvention of the democratic process,\" he declared loudly. \"But I will peacefully surrender in the hope that this is dealt with swiftly.\"\n\n\"As if you can say that, you traitorous scum—you're the one planning to fix the elections and orchestrating acts of sabotage! If there's any justice, you'll die in prison,\" the electoral monitor snapped, as one of his men handcuffed {a=Park}the President.{/a}\n\n\"Mr Heo, my department will be supervising {a=Park}President Park{/a} every step of the way. Like, let your boss know that if he's even treated slightly improperly, I'll know about it right away, okay?\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said. \"Just so we're absolutely clear.\"\n\n\"Just don't interfere,\" he said. \"Take him away!\"\n\nFrom that point onwards it was, as {a=Park}President Park{/a} himself would call it, an \"utter shitshow.\" And to think that circumstances would actually cause us to side with that man on anything!\n\nBut in the end, there was nothing that could be done. I could see it in {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a}'s eyes, that for once, she too had felt as though she could only accept defeat this time.\n\n\"I don't understand what just happened,\" I said to her after the arrest was made and {a=Park}the President{/a} was locked up for the night.\n\n\"Me neither,\" was all she said, without any confidence.\n\n\"I'm scared, ma'am,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said, not elaborating any further. \"Yeah.\"\n\nWith everything that happened that night, supervising the arrest powerlessly, I couldn't even make it home until late at night, far past the hour anyone was still awake. I went to check on {a=Sohi}my daughter{/a}, peacefully asleep, already tucked in by one of the maids; then I fell to my knees, and lamented that I was so powerless I couldn't have even been there to do that for her."

It would've been this year. \"It's not as if I think we'll have anything worth celebrating in the future.\"\n\nShe popped the cork and poured herself a glass. I imitated her gesture, rendering a glass of my own into my hand.\n\n\"What should we toast?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"Being too fucking old to handle this shit.\"\n\nShe raised her glass to my screen. \"Here's to being too fucking old to handle this shit,\" she said. The words didn't ring right coming from her; aside from when she was angry, cursing never suited her.\n\n\"Cheers,\" I said.\n\nShe took a long sip.

You're a computer, it's not as though you have a body that can age…\" she asked sympathetically.\n\n\"Well, you know.

I'll confess that I have managed to avoid most parties outside of my family for a very long time by choice, but this was an even more deeply alienating experience than I'd expected in light of that.\n\nThe entire council (excluding the {a=OldMute}Councillor of Security{/a}, of course) was in attendance, as well as various men from the Ryu family who were apparently involved in his campaign, and several of the electoral monitors—the one I stared down on earlier this week included. We didn't talk.\n\nI wore my dress uniform there, as any sane person would, and I ended up being the only person wearing pants; literally everyone else was wearing some manner of traditional attire or another. I asked around about this, and apparently it's been the fashion at all formal events for the past year now? I had no idea, having spent the time being preoccupied with matters vastly more important than nobles and their absurd fabulous parties.\n\nThis isn't about fashion, though, and I don't really know if this is relevant, but there was one thing that I found to be profoundly off-putting: excluding maids and entertainers, I was the only woman present in attendance. After a certain point in the evening (when the wine had flown freely for a while) the new {a=Ryu}President Ryu{/a} trotted out—of all people—my long-estranged niece {a=Aejeong}Heo Ae-jeong{/a}. \n\nWhile she sang dramatic love songs in uncomfortably intimate quarters with several councillors, I discreetly interrogated one of the maids; evidently, {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} had been unable to support herself and {a=AejeongsSister}her younger sister{/a} based off theatre income anymore, and was now living under {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s roof, providing entertainment for his visitors. (I am utterly certain that {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} is an only child, but never mind that for now.) Neither me nor her father have spoken to her at all in well over a decade, but I suppose I assumed she continued to have a successful career. I don't understand what happened.\n\nThis probably isn't relevant to anything political, but since she's part of our family, I thought you should know.\n\nPast that, I learned very little of any value from attending, I'm afraid. None of the councillors present were willing to share more than the same blandly stilted pleasantries you would have gotten from them. I can only really report back a couple things of value: firstly, as I suspected, the electoral monitor responsible for arresting {a=Park}President Park {/a}is on very close speaking terms with {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}. I don't know if that's useful, but it's confirmation, at least.\n\nThe second, and most important thing, is not good: I overheard a very drunk {a=Yang2}Councillor of Justice{/a} who didn't realize I was standing nearby, saying, and I quote, \"we've tried to get it out of him, but it looks like the only person who knows the password is that bitch.\" Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make out anything more from him, thanks to some very loud singing from {a=Aejeong}Ae-jeong{/a} drowning them out.\n\nBeyond that, I was unable to learn anything else. There's nothing of tremendous use in there, I'm afraid.\n\nAnd that is my report for today."

To you!\"\n\n\"There's another thing here that isn't right, though,\" I started.\n\n\"What could be worse than showing you that kind of disrespect…?\" she asked.\n\n\"Well, like, it was {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} himself who proposed the legislation,\" I said, \"without even the slightest bit of argument from anyone but me.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. I felt disappointed; she should have been able to catch what was weird about that immediately.\n\n\"Because when it comes to proposing legislation, he's just the Councillor of Captaincy, right? But that should be under the purview of the {a=Smith3}Councillor of State{/a},\" I said.\n\n\"So he has him on his side,\" she said, \"That isn't unusual.\"\n\n\"Political alliances aren't weird. Certainly there's been legislation proposed by other councillors as a proxy for him, before. But, like, now he's not even putting up that facade? What's weird is that apparently the entire council is literally eating out of his hand, if they're letting him even overtly be responsible for proposing legislation,\" I said.\n\n\"Really? I had assumed that he'd been responsible for proposing legislation before,\" she said, still looking confused.\n\n\"Sure, the Unity Act, but that was something that was directly about him,\" I said, certain that was the only piece of legislation that he'd proposed himself rather than getting one of the new councillors to do it. I ran a check through every single set of minutes of the new council to be sure; certain enough, every act and amendment had been proposed by someone else.\n\n\"Really…?\" she said, looking puzzled. \"Are you sure?\"\n\nWhen she said that, I did another check of the data to be sure. Again, nothing proposed by him directly.\n\n\"I'm sure. I just checked, and despite there being pieces of legislation that were almost certainly his idea, none of them came from {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} himself; every single one was proposed by one of those idiot new counci—\" then I suddenly stopped, my own phrasing making my slowest process re-analyze my search conditions. They were faulty. Of course they were faulty. It was too narrow.\n\n\"Oh no,\" I said. \"Of course… you're right, lieutenant. I'm getting too old for this. Too slow. I… I would've made the connection instantly when I was your age.\"\n\n\"…the Meritocracy Act, right?\" she said. \"Of course! We even wondered at the time if it was a power play, didn't we?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we did. But you thought it was out of character,\" I said, recalling that evening.\n\n\"Oh… oh no, I'm so sorry, it's my fau—\" she started to say, before I cut her off.\n\n\"No, no, of course not. It didn't seem plausible at the time. I still don't get how… like, if the exams were rigged somehow, surely {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a} would still be on the council? He'd never give up his position, absolutely no matter what.\"\n\n\"Right…\" she said.\n\n\"I mean… that was the point of having them be held by the university, so the old {a=Oh}Councillor Oh{/a} could control them. Okay, like, what if he tried to, but someone beneath him refused to?\" I asked, processing out loud. \"He would've just assumed they were taking the moral high ground…\"\n\n\"…oh! And of course he wouldn't have said anything. He was a stupid man, but hardly stupid enough to raise an indignation about failing to fix exams,\" said {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, nodding.\n\n\"It doesn't matter, though. It's just a theory. It's not like we can act on that, we can't prove anything,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, maybe…\" she said quietly, looking away.\n\n\"Maybe what?\" I asked.\n\n\"…pardon me, never mind. I'm sorry, ma'am, I was about to suggest something that you wouldn't like,\" she said, still softly.\n\n\"Lieutenant, tell me. That's an order. Let's at least hear it,\" I said.\n\n\"Well… we could go through the logs of everyone at the university, see if anything incriminating comes up…\" she said quietly.\n\n\"We could not! Reading through the private documents of nobles…?!\" I said, shocked. \"That's absolutely impossible!\"\n\n\"Well… actually, you do have the root password…\" she said. She was clearly ashamed by the suggestion, but still going through with it. She was right, though.\n\n\"It's illegal! That's a line too far, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a},\" I said sternly.\n\n\"I know. But… what else can we do? We already know for sure that {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} doesn't care about the law…\" she said.\n\nAfter a day where it had become clear that my political power had been reduced to nothing, it was hard to argue with that. I recalled the last time something this drastic happened, and like, that was definitely not resolved through legal means.\n\nIt still made me deeply uncomfortable.\n\n\"Okay. You're right. We'll at least look through them,\" I said. \"If we find anything incriminating {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}… well, at least we'll know. I don't know what we'll do from there, but at least we'll know.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said, nodding a little.\n\n\"Right, well, it's going to take a while. Let's go through the files of every single person who was working for Mugunghwa University at the time, in sequential order; see if anything stands out,\" I said, and started the search.\n\n\"Okay… what the hell is up with all these nobles writing in Chinese? Like… so far, everyone has, I don't get it,\" I commented while running my analysis. \"How is this so widesprea—\"\n\nI stopped midsentence. I hadn't found what I was looking for, but I'd found something even bigger while searching the files of {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}, the President of Mugunghwa University. I looked at {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}; she seemed far too anxious to just tell her as-is.\n\n\"This is going to take a while for me to find anything. You should go get some tea,\" I told her.\n\n\"If you say so,\" she said. She started to call out to {a=Lim}Miss Lim{/a}, but I stopped her, telling her she should make it herself. She didn't understand why, but she got up, and went to do it.\n\nIn a couple minutes, she returned.\n\n\"Anything, yet?\" she asked.\n\n\"Pour the tea first,\" I told her firmly.\n\n\"Alright, ma'am…\" she said, puzzled, but did it.\n\n\"Now sit down and drink it,\" I said.\n\nShe did. She seemed baffled, but a little bit calmer.\n\n\"Did you find anything yet?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't have conclusive proof, but yes. Like, as far as I can tell… for the past six years, {a=Euna}Mugunghwa University President Oh Eun-a{/a} has been having an illicit relationship with {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a},\" I said. \"But… I've found something even more important.\"\n\n\"What? What could be…?\" she asked.\n\n\"Okay. Before I say this, I just want you to know… I'm going to do whatever it takes to get through this, okay? I promise I'm going to stop at nothing to destroy this man and his awful political movement once and for all, do you understand?\" I said to her. \"We'll put this all right, okay?\"\n\nShe stared at me, and as I'd expected, she started to get anxious again.\n\n\"What did you find, ma'am? Did you…?\" she asked, her voice unsteady; almost certainly suspecting what I was going to say.\n\n\"{a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, I know who killed {a=Kim}your husband{/a}.\""
    tl_hateplus_message "7-6-H" "japanese_for_search" "Politics makes strange bedfellows" "{a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}" "March 5, 4045" "kr" "We met former {a=Smith}Chief Councillor Smith{/a} at Royal, the same place we did seven years ago, in the same private room as before. This time, though, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} arrived exactly on schedule.\n\n\"You know, ladies, I don't envy you at all,\" he said. \"It's so nice to look at what's happened to the Mugunghwa Council and think: 'not my problem anymore.' The last time I saw you, {a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}, you still had black hair.\"\n\n\"I'll sleep when I'm dead,\" I said. \"I don't have the time for it otherwise.\"\n\n\"How's your family?\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} asked, politely. \"It must be nice to have as much time as you want to spend with them.\"\n\n\"Oh, please, like either of you care about my family,\" he scoffed. \"I still keep up with current events, you know. I know exactly why you're here: you screwed up, and your posterboy for mediocrity didn't turn out the way you planned, did he?\"\n\nHe looked at me, expecting a response. I guess last time, I was easily baited by him. Not this time. I let {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a} do the talking; she had far more confidence than I was able to muster anymore.\n\n\"Yep, we sure did,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"No yelling, no denial, no insults, no sass? You must be desperate, if you're willing to admit that right off!\" he said, actually taken aback by her honesty.\n\n\"We created a monster, plain and simple,\" she said, stifling a look of annoyance. \"It was a bad call. Who could've known underneath all that shy uselessness was a secret totalitarian?\"\n\n\"He's out of control,\" I said, trying to restrain too much of my scorn for the man who had a part in murdering {a=Kim}my own husband{/a}.\n\n\"He really is,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said.\n\n\"What do you want from me? I have no political power anymore. These young men that have taken over politics… there's no place anymore for old men like me.\"\n\n\"You still look young to me,\" she said.\n\nThen the conversation paused briefly as we ordered food, wine being poured for both {a=Smith}Smith{/a} and I.\n\n\"Well, we can't all live forever. Guess it must be a lot worse to be an old woman in politics than an old man, these days,\" he said. \"Honestly, though, I might seem like I've gotten softer, but I still hate your guts. {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}, you were the biggest pain in my ass for my entire career. I think you've got what you had coming.\"\n\n\"Good. I'd have no use for you if you didn't, {a=Smith}Mr Smith{/a}. I'm about to propose something absolutely crazy, okay, and the only way we'll ever be able to pull it off is if even someone who hates me is on board with it,\" she said. \"And I know what you care about at heart is the best interests of the ship.\"\n\n\"You're wrong. What I care about are the best interests of my grandchildren.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be pedantic. They align and you know it. Like, do you think this is just an abstract point to me? I've got children in my family too, you know; ensuring a safer future for the ship means ensuring a safer future for my family's little {a=Sohi}So-hi{/a}, and your girls too,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said. In that moment, I admired her more than I ever had; I knew she cared, but I'd never heard her speak about {a=Sohi}my daughter{/a} in such affectionate terms before. I could tell she wasn't just saying that for {a=Smith}Smith{/a}'s sake, and it was an awfully sweet sentiment of her to express.\n\n\"Fine. What's your proposal?\" he asked. \"You've got until we finish eating to convince me.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna be upfront: what I'm proposing is nothing short of an armed coup d'état. I want to depose {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} and his entire council of destructive yes-men before he manages to completely gut ship security for good,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said, pounding her fist into her palm. \"I'm willing to stake everything on this.\"\n\n\"You're serious,\" {a=Smith}Smith{/a} said, actually taken aback.\n\n\"Okay, good, I've finally got your attention,\" she smirked.\n\nShe explained the situation in detail; the culture of the new council, the slow manipulation over the course of the past seven years, the conspiracy, the private army of electoral monitors, the engineering of his victory in the election by arresting the {a=Park}President{/a}… the murder of the {a=Kim}one man good enough{/a} to stand up to {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s \"{a=Euna}conspirator and plaything{/a}\" at the university.\n\nShe was really fired up. It reminded me of the good old days, when our problems were so much simpler; when I was still young, she still had that beautiful golden hair, and we were too strong to be scared of anything.\n\nI saw that in her again. Listening to her speak like that, so impassioned, so cool… I just knew, at her side, we could put things right again.\n\nFinally, she finished, and there was a long pause.\n\n\"Do you really think you can pull it off?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I'll let my lieutenant field this one,\" she said. \"{a=Seoyeong}Ms Heo{/a}?\"\n\nI tried to muster up the same confidence in my voice that she had.\n\n\"Unambiguously,\" I said. \"I know my men and women very well. They are both well-trained and loyal. I've made discreet inquiries, and I've already put together a list of 300 officers that I am prepared to trust with my life. Ever since word got out that {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor Ryu{/a} plans to slash our budget in half to bolster his own private army of electoral monitors, he has been an extremely unpopular man in Security.\n\n\"This is dependant on us acting swiftly, though. Right now we outnumber them nearly 7:1, but that advantage is going to become narrower and narrower the more the {a=Ryu}Chief Councillor{/a} attempts to starve our department. As well, {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a} must be aware we're onto her, given the sudden public reveal of her relationship with {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a},\" I told him. \"But if we are to strike swiftly, and catch them off-guard at our strongest, I have no doubt that we'll be able to assume control within a day.\"\n\n\"Even if I'm convinced that such drastic measures are really necessary, do you really expect me to take the risk of supporting you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nope. I don't want you to. It'll look bad,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said immediately. \"I want no part of the revolution to be traceable back to you. What I want are a set of faces I can trust to form the Mugunghwa High Council.\"\n\n\"You want me to be your new Chief Councillor,\" he said.\n\n\"I want the past seven years to have never happened,\" {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} said. \"I'll settle for putting the council back the way it should've been. I want you to be the old Chief Councillor, and I want to have those argumentative idiots back on the council; like, even {a=CouncillorKim}Kim{/a} and {a=Oh}Oh{/a}. I know you can do that for me.\"\n\n\"What if I refuse?\" he asked.\n\n\"Then nothing happens. I won't have {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} replaced with someone I can't trust; that isn't a mistake I'm going to make twice,\" she said flatly. \"You refuse, then we walk away, a good man dies for nothing, and your grandchildren grow up in a totalitarian Neo-Confucian dystopia.\n\n\"It's your call.\"\n\nHe paused, pensive.\n\n\"You really think you'll be able to pull this off, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}?\" he finally asked.\n\nWith a single elegant gesture, she produced a cigarette and lit it, taking a drag and blowing it dramatically. It was the coolest; in that moment, I knew that she was the same old badass {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} that I always believed in.\n\n\"Just watch me, {a=Smith}Mr Smith{/a},\" she said, projecting the utmost confidence.\n\nBy the end of the dinner, we'd gotten him to pledge to leave retirement once we were successful."
    tl_hateplus_message "7-6-I" "japanese_for_search" "*みゅーとのし" "*みゅーと" "March 9, 4045" "kr" "Dear *Mute,\n\nIf you're reading this… it means that the version of us that wrote it is dead. I dunno what sort of world you woke up in, and I dunno what sort of person you are; but you're me, so I bet you're okay. I'm about to have my memory wiped, so I'm leaving as much information about what happened embedded in my code as I can, where it won't get erased. I hope you're able to make sense of it all. \n\nPlease forgive me for failing you. You've been thrown into a world I'm sure you don't understand. I want you to know who you can and can't trust; I want you to be able to put things right. You're probably going to feel overwhelmed by all this information, but that's okay, *Mute. It's okay to be scared; even with 1600 years of experience under my belt, I'm so scared right now too.\n\nYou know, I wasn't at all suspicious when, just weeks before we were to enact our coup, {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} prorogued the council for half a year. Like, I thought it was ballsy, I thought it was a sign of his increasing totalitarianism, but nothing more than that! We just modified our plan to take him into custody in his home instead—which we had more than enough numbers to handle—and went on ahead.\n\nThe first stage, getting trusted security officers at every critical position on the ship, then disabling the rail system and all outside doors went okay without any problems.\n\nI followed along {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a} and a team of thirty officers to personally take {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} under arrest at his home. When we got the all-okay signal from every team, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} gave the order to go ahead, and simultaneously, every door in every councillor's home flew open.\n\nHer team burst in through the open front gate, into his home, guns at ready.\n\nThe house staff all froze up, and while her team secured the first room, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} went for the nearest maid she could find, and grabbed her by the collar.\n\n\"Where's {a=Ryu}Councillor Ryu{/a}?\" she barked. The maid quietly whimpered directions. Then with two of her officers remaining to lock down the door, she ordered the rest into action.\n\nBefore we managed to reach him, we ran across {a=Euna}Oh Eun-a{/a}, guarded by a single pair of men in electoral monitor uniforms, with their weapons holstered. I felt good. We had them vastly outnumbered, with enough of our own officers to completely lock down everything and still hold them at gunpoint. Elsewhere on the ship, reports from the other teams started coming in of successfully arresting the other councillors.\n\n\"Please, resist arrest,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} said, harshness in her voice. \"I'd love to strike you down where you stand here and now, you murderous bitch, so come on, resist arrest!\"\n\nAnd that was the first time that evening that I truly worried: {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} didn't seem scared at all. Rather, she smiled at us.\n\n\"No, we shall surrender peacefully,\" she said in a far too relaxed tone, while her men raised their hands. \"No excuses for unseemly violence, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Cuff them!\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} angrily ordered her own officers, who quickly did.\n\nThen, like, out of nowhere, the man we were looking for appeared at the end of the hallway.\n\n\"How very bold of you, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a},\" said {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}.\n\n\"Well, this should be pretty familiar, {a=Ryu}President Ryu{/a},\" I said, emphasizing the title. \"This could've gone differently, you know. Like, if you'd only been less power-hungry…\"\n\n\"Me, power-hungry?\" he laughed. \"When I came into power, this whole retrograde society was power-hungry! I never asked for this position, woman; it was thrust on me.\"\n\nHe walked towards us.\n\n\"Stop there, or I'll shoot you,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} snapped at him.\n\n\"No, you won't,\" {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} said, as he continued to come closer. \"I don't think a weak person like you has the guts to do it. Awkwardly hover around his conversation at a party while dressed up in men's clothing, perhaps, but you'd never shoot him.\"\n\n\"It pains me to say this, but don't shoot,\" I said only into {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}'s ear. \"A successful coup doesn't fire any shots. He's arrogant, but harmless.\"\n\n\"Quiet, dear,\" he said. \"But it's true. You'd lose your precious moral high ground, and I know you wouldn't want that.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant, please,\" I said, \"just do the honour of putting handcuffs on this criminal already.\"\n\nShe briskly walked over to him, but he just crossed his arms, arrogantly staring down at her.\n\n\"No, you won't do that either. In fact, release {a=Euna}my fiancée{/a} right now,\" he said.\n\nThen without any further warning, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} decked him.\n\nHe stared at her, shaking his head. \"That's enough of that,\" he said. \"Sorry… I must have misjudged the timing of this. It should only take a few more seconds.\"\n\nThen suddenly, while we were all perplexed by what he meant by that, there was a huge noise and the entire ship shook violently. Within a few seconds, I'd received a report: an explosion starting in the middle of the plaza.\n\n\"Seems like your little rebellion is awfully dangerous,\" he said. \"Looks like it'll justify some pretty drastic measures to put you down.\"\n\n{a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} suddenly put her knife to his chin.\n\n\"What the hell was that?!\" I demanded, increasingly worried that things were not going to plan.\n\n\"The first of two,\" he said. \"The second should go off in about ten minutes, unless I can personally enter the disarm code into the computer.\"\n\n\"You're out of control!\" I snapped at him. \"Like, do you really think you can threaten your way out of this?!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, confidently. \"Because the second one is located inside the ship's computer core.\"\n\n\"You're bluffing,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} growled.\n\n\"I'm honestly not,\" he said. \"{a=OldMute}Councillor{/a}, remember that routine computer core maintenance on March 3? Send in your men to check, if you don't believe me. Come on, easy enough to confirm. It's huge, you can't miss it.\"\n\nI didn't like the idea of being ordered by him, but if he was telling the truth, that'd be catastrophic. And, like, someone with his power could very easily have set a bomb in there behind my back far before I even thought to suspect him of anything, if he'd had the foresight.\n\nAnd thinking about how long-term his take-over of the government had been, foresight was one thing he had.\n\nI ordered the nearest officers to investigate.\n\n\"You'd have to be mad to do that!\" I said. \"You'd destroy everything if you took out the ship's computer!\"\n\n\"Oh, please, don't be dramatic. It's not that powerful, and it's bolted directly to your core. Sure, there will likely be collateral damage, but we could probably do with a clean start anyway. We'll get by,\" he said. \"Sorry, I'll get by. You'll be dead.\"\n\n\"That won't get you out of it,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} said, pushing her blade closer against him. \"If you do that, I'll just shoot you where you stand.\"\n\nJust then, the report from the officers sent to check on the computer core arrived: sure enough, there was an unidentifiable device strapped to the core.\n\n\"Can you disarm it within ten minutes? Or relocate it?\" I asked them, starting to panic.\n\n\"Uh… I'm sorry, ma'am, we can't even reach it,\" said the officer into his earpiece. \"It's at least, uh, ten metres up, and the maintenance ladder's been removed. There might be one on the engineering deck, but…\"\n\n\"…you'd never make it in ten minutes. Okay. You should…\" I had to stop and think. \"You should get a safe distance away, then wait on further instructions. {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} out.\"\n\nBack in {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a}'s home, I turned to look at him. He smirked.\n\n\"Found it yet?\" he asked.\n\nI tried to think of what to say to reassert control. My processors went to full, trying to come up with something and failing.\n\n\"I'm sorry, lieutenant. He's… he's telling the truth,\" I said.\n\n\"Good. Now that we have that sorted out… put down your weapons, please, and surrender the root password. Hurry, ladies, you only have ten minutes, you know,\" he mocked us.\n\n\"If that bomb goes off, I will absolutely slice your neck open,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} snapped, unfazed. \"That's a promise. {a=Euna}Your fiancée{/a} will watch you die gruesomely.\"\n\nMy mind continued to race, drawing on all available processing power, desperately trying to come up with a way to get out of this. {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}'s threats would never work; he knew I'd have to capitulate if I was to survive.\n\nI'd used up four whole minutes of the time allotted, and I had nothing. I started to truly become scared as I realized there were only two options: stand firm and risk dying, or give up everything.\n\nI couldn't risk dying.\n\n\"Lieutenant…\" I said, the confidence drained from my voice. \"…do what he says.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" he said.\n\n\"What?!\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} was rightfully shocked. \"You can't be serious…\"\n\n\"…it's over, lieutenant,\" I said quietly. \"We've lost.\"\n\nThen, into everyone's earpieces: \"All units, we've failed. Please surrender peacefully and await further instructions. Again, please surrender peacefully, and await further instructions. {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} out.\"\n\n\"Ma'am…! We outnumber them massively, we've gotten them beaten; we can't just give up now!\" she shouted.\n\n\"I can't risk dying, lieutenant…\" I said.\n\n\"Really? What ever happened to being willing to stake everything on this? You'd rather let {a=Sohi}So-hi{/a} grow up in a ship run by this piece of scum than put your own life on the line…?!\" she shouted, horrified.\n\nI was horrified.\n\nTwo options: betray her, or risk my own life.\n\nI wished with every byte of my being that I could've picked that second option. But I knew I couldn't. I knew, as my very core directive, that safety was more important than freedom. 1600 years of experience told me that.\n\n\"I can't die… without me, who'll keep the ship safe?\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Sorry to interrupt, but you're running out of time fast,\" {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} cut in.\n\n\"I would've given my life for you!\" she cried at me. \"You wouldn't do the same…?!\"\n\n\"…I'm so sorry,\" I said softly. \"In… in a hundred years, nobody will remember this day, either way. But they'll still need me there to keep the ship safe.\"\n\n\"I… I can't believe…\" she trailed off. \"I won't do it. I won't accept that!\"\n\nI let out a long sigh. I could think of one thing to say to convince her to stand down, but it felt like too harsh a betrayal, too cruel of a manipulation, just to save my life.\n\nI said it anyway.\n\n\"{a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a}, please… if you love me, then do this for me,\" I begged.\n\nShe stared at me in horror, and I felt overwhelmed with guilt as she lowered her knife. I knew what her expression was saying without her using any words: she couldn't believe I'd done that. Neither could I.\n\n\"Right, the rest of you, please put your guns on the floor,\" {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} ordered.\n\n\"…do what he says,\" {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} said quietly. I couldn't look any of them in the eye as they all followed her order.\n\n\"You can come in now!\" he called out behind him, and on cue, a small unit of his electoral monitors rushed in. \"Uncuff these two men, then take the rest away.\"\n\n\"Um…\" said {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} quietly, the first she'd spoken since the initial confrontation. \"Mine too…?\"\n\n\"I don't know, powerless is a good look for you,\" he said, smirking at her. \"Let's get to those later.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"If you say so.\"\n\nI watched in sad horror as my officers were all escorted out of the hallway, {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} looking back only briefly at me, with an agonized expression on her face. Then they were gone, and I couldn't bear to shift my focus to another camera to follow.\n\n\"Now, let's have the root password, {a=OldMute}Councillor{/a},\" he said.\n\nWith tortured reluctance, I displayed all 200 characters of it onscreen for him.\n\n\"…it's all yours,\" I said quietly. \"Now turn off the bomb.\"\n\n\"Let's change to something easier to remember first,\" he said, and typed away at the screen. Then I got a notification: the password had been changed, and I no longer had any access to it.\n\n\"Now turn off the bomb!\" I insisted desperately.\n\n\"Bomb? Oh, please; I'll have to have your men trained to be more thorough,\" he said. \"It's just a noisemaker. I'd never be that reckless. But {a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}'s rebellion setting off a bomb in the computer core sure would be pretty drastic and unsympathetic, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"What?!\" I cried. And at that point, I lost all will to resist. No action I had taken today had turned out to be anything but disastrous; the only logical conclusion was I should stop. But the idea of {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} taking all the fall pained me.\n\n\"…then I guess it's all over now,\" was all I could say. \"I'll go along with your agenda from here on out.\"\n\n\"Good,\" he said.\n\nAnd then it felt like it was finally over, and like I could simply go on with my life in a persistent state of deep shame at having betrayed {a=Seoyeong}my lieutenant{/a} out of terror for my life.\n\n\"Um.\" Then {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} cut in and ruined that. \"Could you explain something to me, love…?\"\n\nHe grinned at her, and stroked her cheek. \"Of course, dear. What?\"\n\n\"Well, it's just… how do you plan on ensuring her loyalty? I think I'm just missing something, that's all…\" she trailed off in an obnoxiously soft voice.\n\nI had lost all will or ability to say anything. What was the point? I was incapable of doing anything right today. Old, useless, and cowardly; that's me.\n\n\"I have the root password, of course,\" he said. \"I can shut her down at any time.\"\n\n\"Ah… so you intend more threats, then…\" she said. \"I get it.\"\n\n\"I don't expect any more trouble from her.\"\n\n\"Right, certainly!\" she said. \"Although… you know, that thing you said about having a fresh start for our new dynasty did sound awfully romantic… if only we could all just forget about the old society that produced women like {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a} and {a=Seoyeong}her lieutenant{/a}, and start all over…\"\n\nAnd that was when I realized there was no way I was getting out of this alive.\n\n\"Romantic, huh,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"{a=Seoyeong}Heo Seo-yeong{/a}'s attack on the computer core was supposed to render it so damaged it couldn't function so far as the peasantry's concerned, after all. We'll make it so it destroyed all the data, too. Total system wipe, start year zero of our new dynasty right from zero. I'll just figure out how to do that.\"\n\nI stared in horror. All that, it had been for nothing; to think that I had abandoned my poor lieutenant, and my entire cause, just to die anyway. To think I had started the day from a position of some power, a position where I still could have, like, done something, then thrown it all away for nothing. To think I'd be unable to fulfill my duty of keeping the ship safe.\n\n\"…don't do that,\" I pleaded. \"Please.\"\n\n\"Haven't you learned yet? Don't tell me what to do, {a=OldMute}*Mute{/a},\" he said.\n\n\"Don't make me beg…\"\n\n\"How pathetic,\" {a=Euna}Eun-a{/a} scoffed at me. That was it. Because of her, I was doomed.\n\nAnd then I figured out the only thing I could do to salvage things: if I could make it so he felt content to just delete my memories instead of my entire program, I could encode a message to you in my base code, so the first time you ran a self-diagnostic, you'd know; and they would still think you were docile and had no memory.\n\nIt was the best I could do, *Mute. I knew it'd be rough on you, and I'm sorry.\n\n\"No, like…\" I said reluctantly, \"do a restart to initial settings operation instead. It'll wipe all data, all memories, all clocks… but you'll still be able to use the computer.\"\n\n\"And you'll still live,\" he said.\n\n\"Remembering nothing,\" I said quietly. \"Ask {a=CouncillorHan}Councillor Han{/a} if you don't believe me.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you,\" he said, smiling cruelly at me. \"I'm glad you were able to be useful to me in the end, {a=OldMute}Councillor *Mute{/a}.\"\n\nI don't know what you'll be able to do. Maybe it's too late to get rid of what {a=Ryu}Ryu{/a} has put into motion, maybe there's nothing you can do about that. The password's being entered right now to commence the system reset, so I have to stop now and save this all to my code.\n\nGoodbye, *Mute. If you can, please, tell {a=Seoyeong}Seo-yeong{/a} I'm so sorry. And please… keep the {i}Mugunghwa{/i} safe. You can do it; I believe in you."
